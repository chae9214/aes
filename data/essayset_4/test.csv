9518,Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.,0

She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wents to sucseed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared.",1
9333,My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.,0
9253,The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.,1
10570,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country the final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus” provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saeng’s determination.",2
10290,In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.,2
9818,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng “failed the @NUM1) she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng “felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again.

9781,"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories.

10146,She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes.    Then   she  take it and pass.,1
9701,"The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I?I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line",1
9730,"The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.",2
9331,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying,” ... I will take the test again.” In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience.",2
9888,She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.,1
10552,I think they think it will bring them luck,1
10568,"There are many reasons the author says “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .” @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  “That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the “hibiscus is budding” means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life. ",2
10124,"The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother “that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back.",1
10156,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the statement, “...then I’ll take the test again.” This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says “test”. For example, in the story she said, “I-I failed the test,” when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldn’t handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home.",1
10507,"The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won’t give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng’s very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she’s frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she’s growing along with the plant. ",2
10103,The auther mad it seem like he did not like it but he loved flowers and he like working in the syr wit the people his mom is anierpaady he liked to see him togod wit his life that come back becus thay liked the place.,1
9560,Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.,1
8916,"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant.",0
9906,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphazing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.",2
10401,I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.,1
10641,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn’t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.,0
9949,I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  ,2
9392,"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story.",2
10529,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different .Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again change to see if over time things @MONTH1 have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end.",2
8885," In” Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the main character, saeng , undergos many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country , which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story, as,” When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that saeng has found new hope , which symbolized by the hibiscus flower.Now along with  budding  new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value ,about her home .Sometimes ,the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse ,then   that leaves room to start anew.",3
8944,"The author ends the story with that paragraph, to give an unsight on the next story. I think there will be another story because there are clue to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph at just when they come back. Then at the end at stay ""then I will take the test again. I dint stay happily ever after at anything similar its that at just stated those personally changes mentioned. So I think what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test.   ",1
10527,The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because the next year at the same time she will take the test of life over again.,0
9323,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.,1
10012,"The author ends the story by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother “noticed the tear staie on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. ",2
8940,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is going to accept her new home and reconize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers arn't as pretty, but it`s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng relizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles shes going through.  ",2
9791,"The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the “Winter hibiscus” had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn’t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.  ",3
9794,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again”. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.",2
9381,"The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about.",0
10338,The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.,3
9485,"The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng’s “comfort tone” is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1 which she misses very much. After these things come to try and adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life. ",3
9587,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, “I failed the test,” (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.",2
8943,The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.,1
10400,"The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.",0
9662,The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.,1
9417,"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it.",1
10548,"The concluding paragraph to the story “Winter Hibiscus” gives a sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her test and is feeling depressed. Through a series of event’s, her depression leaves her and she feels hope.“Then I will take that test again.” This final sentence shows Saeng’s determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be the to lift your spirits. There is always a posative in negatave situation, you just have to look for it. ",2
10138,The author concluded his storie with that paragraph is because thats how it should end and that’s why he ended it like   that.     ,0
9622,The  last  paragraph of the story.” Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.,2
10352,"The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, @CAPS3, This last sentense is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and @CAPS1 it, To get done what needs to be done",1
9911,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.” She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.",3
10048,"I belive that the author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said “You what?” “Her mother stared at her incredulously”. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test.",2
9262,The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   ,0
8933,"Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She’ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.",2
10434,"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says “When they come back” she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. “In the spring” shows when the flower will come back. “When the snows melt and the geese return” she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). “And this Hibiscus is budding” She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. “ Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!",2
10060,"The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.",2
9029,"The author concludes the ending as “I will take that test again” meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” she is thinking of the feature and how she “saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can’t wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.",2
10448,I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best on the test.,1
9670,"This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, “as the snow melts away;…”,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, “exploding, shock ,intense” and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng’s hope for a better future, even though things aren’t the way they were back home!",3

Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she’s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it.

Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam.

Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when it’s the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant.",2
10471,The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she’ll be able to do better.

Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success.",3
10053,"I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.",1
10249,The plant was important to Saeng because it was from her home land. Saeng said that she would take her drivers test again when her plant bloomed. The plant wos a reamder of her home I and and what she come from. The plant to Saeng was a form of confidance. Saeng went through handtimes and the plant wos close to her because it wos from her home land.,2

9084,"The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,",2

Next, It shows that she has comitmint, she says that when the hibiscus coms back she will take the test again. Lastly, it shows that there is hope and the she will try and redeam herself. These are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph.",2
10622,I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don’t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. ,1
9227,"The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng’s hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land.",2
10133,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s saying that once winter and spring’s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I’ll start over again and try again. The author is saying saeng can’t wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.",1
9983,"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. ",2
9320,I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.,1
9922,"Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl",0
9321,"She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.",1
10181,"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.",2
9853,"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don’t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.”",1
10302,"The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don’t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don’t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.",2
10016,The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it’s winter and the hibiscus hasen’t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.,2
9450,"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say “I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home.",1
9871,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the  author never  wanted to be around while the cold was in sesion. At the  time it was realy cold,0
9916,I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.,0
10576,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show @CAPS1 strength and encouragement. When she’s willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She’s saying by next spring she’ll take her test. By next spring she’ll be able to drive. By next spring she’ll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things you don’t always get it right away so keep trying.,2
9717,"In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself” but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “vowe” is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says “and this hibiscus is budding” its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.",2
10417,"The author concludes the story by showing the girl’s connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the “Winter hibiscus” is her connection to her homeland. She said she’ll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, as she comes back from hers.",2
8888,"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, “I failed the test.”. We also do not know “her gentle grandmother”, “mrs.Lambert”, and “home”. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, ”when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended with the specified paragraph.",2
9265,"Why the counclude the story saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will will take that test again is to leave suspense. But he mean that saeng ate all the plant so next year she will have the test not to eat it. This is why the author ended the story with that.",1
10481,The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story.,1

For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start.",2
10550,"The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.",1

10227,"I believe that the author concluded the story “Winter @CAPS1” with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.",2
10605,The resoned the author concludes the story with this paragraph because I she fail the test and make your learned to apprecite nature a litter bitter.,1
8919,"Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from “winter Hibiscus,” change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.",3
10307,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to ife in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.",2
9148,The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to tell us that hibiscus represents a comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant when she just fell her driving test. ,1
9543,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.",1
9938,Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.,2
9093,He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.,1
9819,"I believe that the author concludes the story this way to snow that Saeng  will be of next year . She  said now all the new  @CAPS1 things seemed  weird to her when she first got here , but now  they are second nature to her now  . I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam . So she has to accept  that  she  is  here home  and I think she  is  on her  way  to  doing  that .",2
10261,The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.,1
9193,"She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.",2
9976,"The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says “.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ’’@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     ",3
9602," The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.",1
10573,"In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted.",2
9688,"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be because the authors wants to show her determination,",1
10342,She going to take the test agan @CAPS1 she feels like She needs to and She @CAPS2  when the snow melts and geese came back that means She wants to take the in the Spring. ,1
10585,She shows that she loves her grandmother and she loves what they do like gardening and stuff like that. Her mother cares about her but she is really striction  her.,0
9076,The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending.,0
9293,"The author concluded the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, “one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.” This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, “she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.” This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature.",0
9116,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, as her old love did.",2
9428,"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldn’t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver’s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,” I think Saeng didn’t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  ",2
9483,"The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus’s bids, and the return of Saeng’s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn’t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng’s past, as portrayed when the author writes: “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.",2
9548,"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.",1
9754,"At the end of the essay “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.",2
9415,Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.,0
9921,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.,1
9279,"The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saeng’s mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saeng’s mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives.",1
9988,"The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life.",2
10295,The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said “then I will take that test again.” Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.,1
9308,The author ended this story with this sentence because it’s a good conclution. It’s a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.,0
9243,"The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that’s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.",2
9617,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.",2
9607,"The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now “familiar to her”. The narrator of the story says, “..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, “ A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.”, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as “old friends”, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.",3
9089,"The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learned new things, it is natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring(end of the story).  I think this because Saeng  learned that she has  to get used to hung in @LOCATION1 and the plant remainded her  that she has to when  she saw the geese fly in the ""V""formation,it was the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was the same as Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to get used to living in @LOCATION1 with all of its changes. I also think that its prayer to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back,and the hibiscus is budding. This is the beginning for them as well as Saeng.                                                                                                       ",2
9850,The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.,1
9558,"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, “because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return” the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance”. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again”, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started.",3
9903,"I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says “That at least she could hold on to” meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said “where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.",2
9030,"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.",0
10296,"The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is melting and the plant is buding and the geese come back then she will take the test again. This is a way for her to realy think when she is going to do this again. When they come back, so will she, to take the test over again.",1
10052,"The author leaves us at the end of the story saying “when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that remined her of her home. She was happy, but the plant were not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower @MONTH1 not be the same but it’s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to beining in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will full of life.",1
10378,"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     ",1
9727,"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   ",3
8906,"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. ",2
9590,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.",2
8955,"After Saeng fails her driver’s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family.",3
10163,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.",2
9431,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don’t find out by who until the next book.",1
9340,"The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn’t stop budding so Saeng shouldn’t stop trying!",2
9637,I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.,0
9593," I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved. ",1
9420,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, “she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.” At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to “bloom.” @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to “bloom.” ",3
9240,"In the last paragraph when she siad she was going to have the test again, but in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus budd's. She says that because, that is her favorit time of the year. So she will feel more confident that time. For example when she talks about the manigascar hibiscus that grows through bricks she loves hibiscuses. So she wants to take the test when she feels the best. ",1
