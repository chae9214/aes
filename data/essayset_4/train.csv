9131,The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.,1
9462,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.",3
10236,"This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver’s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.",3
9062,In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.,0

10466,"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. It you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying, she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never gave up. Saeng had failed the test. She said,""I-I failed the test"". This shows how sad and depressed she was because, the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone. Even though sad depressed Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story “Winter Hibiscus”.  ",2
10246,"The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, ”I will take the test again.” In the story Saeng said, ”I failed the test” but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.",1
9007,"The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng’s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, ”When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before.” But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  ",2
9741,"The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring. ",3
10151,"In the stoRy “WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, “then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last.",2
10184,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt,3
9968,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives.",2
9119,I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I’ll never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.,1
9160,The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. ,0
9434,I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.,0
9064,"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better.",1
9556,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt. ",2
9162,The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when every thing returns to normol and the “geese return and this hibiscus is budding that I will take that test again.” meaning she will be willing to move again and try to adapt.,1
10094,She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said “Then I will take that test again.” That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  ,0
9816,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     ",2
10528,"The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey",2
9613,"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here.",2
9660,"Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says “When they come back,” so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when “the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When “this hibiscus is budding,” so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will “take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass.",2
10492,"In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury. She is also telling you that you need to a paped to newsra winds. That’s why I think they ened with that pargraph",1

The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.

Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past.",2
9885,"The Author includes that part in his story because it’s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther’s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.",0
9940,The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.,2
9675,The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.,1
9598,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,… then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes.

If she wouldn’t have failed her test she probably wouldn’t have got the flower in the first place.",1
9236,"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng.",2
10332,"The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng “comfort in her time of discomfort.” She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, she’ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding.",2
9167,"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:? “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.

She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again.",2
8995,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn’t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.",2

By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. Also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so Saeng can deal with it as well.,1
10519,"The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here.

Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.” Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,”.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again.",3

9294,"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture.

So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.",1
9230,In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. ,2

When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.

The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,”when the snows melt and the geese return” this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   ",3
9267,The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.,1
8887,"The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don’t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story.",2
9474,"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, iN the spring, wheN the @CAPS1 melt and the geese RetuRN and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” means to the author kinda like the meaning to life. That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better.",1
10389,"The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn’t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.",2
8994,The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it that she will realize that they are coming back.,0
9315," Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and bought” a plant it was the ""dok faeng ? noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought “@CAPS1 hibiscus” as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says,” “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change.",2
10422,"“when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now “out of the box,” and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and “failed her test.” The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.  ",3
9616,"The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. ",1
10304,Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don’t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn’t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over.,1
10025,"Throughout this story we are given background information on a girl who deferately misses her true home when we are first introduced to young saeng she is in a flourist’s shop simply looking at flowers, we soon learn that she is not only  looking at flowers but looking a pieces of her home and past, she then purchases a hibiscus which is a flower native to her vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng  will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests",3
10350,"The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.”  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.",3
9784,I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant “starts over” (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a “cliff hanger” to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn’t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this. ,2
9351,I think that the auther end the story Like that as a meterphor For people to think out side the @CAPS1 or thing. OR The auther might oF ended it Like that so people can get a picture in the head about what she was talking about.,0
9936,The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus. ,0
9086,So she did not forget to take the test again.,1
9693,"I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens",1
10543,There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.,1
10542,"The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng’s wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad.",2
10474,The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature’s fight for survival is like Saeng’s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child’s life it’s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.,3
10158,"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments..",3
10216,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn’t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.,0
9326,"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.",1
9309,"The autor of ""winter Hibiscus"" conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to slow that saeg was not going to giving up in that when the thing that was most important to her was complete that she would then take the test again. In the sory it says that ""saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t",2
9405,"In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in the life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn’t forgotten her heritage. “But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.” It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her. She’s going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cherry. Optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it.",2
10592,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes.",3
10456,"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is when everything will be perfect to redo her mistake. Saeng said crying ""I-I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 means she failed at what she thought she was good at. “Here let me help mother"" getting up and taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake she will do better. As the reader can see Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe sh is a great gardener like her mother.",0
9531,The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character’s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.,1
9628,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.",2
9077,The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it’s bond to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says “in the spring………….I will take this test again”. She is just preparing herself for next year. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story.,1
9859,"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus” by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.",2
10160,"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  ",3
9259,The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn’t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.,2
10219,"The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end.",2
9527,"Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph.

As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng.",2
10357,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don’t want to express themselves. Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn’t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think. Think about my life were I am going to go after i die. I just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if I  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth.

10083,"In the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?” When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,",0
10398,"I think the author concludes the story with the phase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.",0
10609,"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open ?minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver’s test. For example, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn’t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.",3
10410,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace.",2
9947,"The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life.",1
10639,The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn’t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.,2
9529,Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.,1
10262,Because planting flowers and wasting on the garden is @CAPS1 hobby. And without it she can’t think clearly or creating. So there fore waiting until they are back will make her happier also she able to do her work.,0
9127,"In the short story ’’Winter Hibiscus,’’ by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring.

For example, ‘’When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again’’(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        ",2
8891,"By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says” when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,”she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. ",3

9705,"The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.",2

Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph.",2

9341,"In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says “Its flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng’s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. ",3
10097,"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. ‘I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. “But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive’s test one more try. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""",2
9835,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.,1

The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term “familiar” to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.

When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.",3
9103,"In the last paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by minfong Ho The author concludes by saying  ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle, For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to over come. Saeng is very strong and she believes off of that determination which comes from her past. The author concluded with that because it shows Saeng’s determination.",2
9226,I think the athor includes that becaus. she mite have faeled and need more time to study to get thing @NUM1 so other than that damn new,0
10159,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn’t used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.",2
10239,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.",2
10578,"I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and?yes?familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.",3
10433,The author used that sentence because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back. The flowers were budding up and that is why I think the author used that sentence. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1,0
9565,I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution if you think about it. And you don’t put the solution any whereelse but the end that is why she put it there.,0
9563,"The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.",1
9745,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what’s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.",1
10174,"I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways.",1
9187,"The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides she’s going to try to retake the test next spring.",2
9129,Because she is going to practice and get better at driving and when the flower blooms she will go take the test agin. And she will try harder next time.,1
9812,"The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow” This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now",2
10073,The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.,1
9721,He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.,1
10308,"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.",3
9966,The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress” a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1,0
9220,"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again”. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she’ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life.",3
9066,"She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.",1
9658,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said ""… I will take that test again"" it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. ",2
10584,"Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.",1
9910,The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.,1
9610,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.",2
9500,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.",2
9019,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story saeng fails her drivers test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adopt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, so it helps saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help saeng realize that she is becaming more familiar with things in the United states, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the “V” shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accostomed to @LOCATION1 and she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change.",3
10030,He concludes the story because he was another chance to etact the test.,0
10220,I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back is when the character feels she would be prepare to take that test again.,1
9801,"There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well” It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said”she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.” This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.",2
9137,I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of  winter.,0
8948,"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote “In the spring…then I will take that test again.” In the text, the girl says “it’s-it’s not a real one,” when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote “… much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness.",3
9214,"The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, to show that even though she failed her test she isn’t giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saeng’s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.",1
10323,"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return”. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  ",3
9003,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus”chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, “I will take that test again”. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence ""…when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle.

9291,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn and in the spring time Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states ""she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author say’s she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.” This reminds her of her old home watching the geese.",2
9642,"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.",2
9713,"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.” means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what theauthor concludes this to the story.",1
10091,"The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it’s because it’s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she’ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant’s situation.",3

The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness.

For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It’s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds.

9946,"The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes “she vowed silently to herself.” When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.",1

No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower.",2
10337,"In the story, “winter hibiscus”, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home.

10248,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.,0
10166,I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn’t giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.,2
8971,"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. ",1

When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, “I-I failed the test,” to now setting a goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle, by ending the story in this way. From speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to state that she will re-take the test, next year. ",3
10547,"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.”    ",3
9810,"I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn’t past the test. I fell she met that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one.",1
9718,"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph).

9367,"The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test “in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,” it’s inspiring to know that she’ll keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise” to take that test again” can be very hard but worthwhile .

She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much “snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring.

From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.

For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test.  ",1
10442,"Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life.",1
9197,The author might of concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a meisly plant thats gonna die anyways. Also because she needs to pass the test and the author is putting in a getall that in the end the girl is gonna pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. but also he/she tells that because he/she wants us to know that it aint all about other things that are expensive in life but that school is really more important than anything basically.,1
10348,At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.,0
9690,Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story.

Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote “I failed the test” with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus.

9510,"This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For instance, Saeng is saying that her new home with her flowers is more important than school and a test. And, saeng doesn’t have many friends go see at school but her hibiscus will remind her of all of her old friends she made. Saeng is simply stating to herself that once everything is back to normal or the way she wants to she it then she can take that test again. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how saeng feels.",1
9394,The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms,1
9631,"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self.

I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change.

Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that “in the spring” when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life’s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver’s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country.

For example in the text the author writes and explain how the plants “dok faeng-noi,” has adapted to its cold environment is different to the ones back at home. This demonstrates the idea of survival be the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when cold streets, it found ways to change itself and adapt all based on the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author     Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of meloncoly and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how she human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor.",3

It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.,2
9592,"The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for.

9775,Because to her it is the best time to do things cause all the happy memories return along with the geese and hibiscus.,1
10058,"In the story “winter hibiscus” by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don’t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn’t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says “when they come back then I will take the test again,“ that’s showing she isn’t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.",1

9151,"Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom “I failed…” When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.",1
9350,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They @MONTH1 have thought that she thaght the test back home were more important.

9780,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn’t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope.",2
9547,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don’t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn’t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.,2

10470,"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.",1
9973,The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.,0

Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That’s why the author concluded the story that way.,1
9051,"The author concludes the story, ”Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can’t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive. ",2
9135,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.,2
9772,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.",1
9576,"The story “Winter Hibiscus” is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, ”When they come back, ‘Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, “Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.""  ",2
9422,"Determined, new beginning, symbolism ? each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism ? each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.",3
9630,"I believe the author of “winter Hibiscus “ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story “it’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.",2
9388,"I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.",1
10445,"Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.",0
10531,The author  says this because she will try to start her own garden. Her other garden didn’t turn out to well. In the book it says she needed her moms help. ,0
9679,Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus.,0
9378,"The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.",1
9856,"The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this",3
10522,"The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. “Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won’t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.",3
9967,"The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng ‘s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.",3
10092,"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.",3
10452,"The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver’s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will “plant a new seed.” The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng’s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect.",2
9924,The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off. So this passage is saying in the spring time when every thing comes back she will start the test again. it is like to start a new life back over.,1
9521,"Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng‘s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus.",2
9732,"A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desprite she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going.",1
10266,"The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her “home” where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.",2
9307,"“then I will take that test again” [@NUM1] Saeng’s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, ""I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the “@CAPS2 Malik” [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort.

She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home.",2
10095,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a ‘test’,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. ”A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'.

9680,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it’s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past.,1
10438,Saeng is @CAPS1 that it Will be a longtime before she will worn about school work again. thats Why the author concluds the story with their paragraph.,0
9301,"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng’s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, “She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  ",3
10503,"The author concludes the story with the sentence saying “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again” because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it’s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing’s then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this let’s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well",2
10501,"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to tell the reader never give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that family is always there because you can't do it on your own. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi"", she finally said",1

9882,He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.,1
10245,The author concludes the story with that quote for one main reason. That reason is that it shows that the girl has hope. In a story one of the best qualities a character can have is hope because it makes the reader interested and helps provide a good morale for the Story. That is why the author concludes the story with that quote.,1
10521,"The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.",2
10136,"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese.",3
10286,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,” This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.",2
9933,The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.,1
10066,"The author includes this last paragraph in the story, “Winter Hibiscus” to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    ",3
10226,The author ended the story with that paragraph because she said that the flower helps her with the moving and remains her of her home town and that when the geese come back and the flower starts to blume she’ll know that she can pass that test. She is sad for failing the test but it doesn’t matter how many times you fail it sooner or later you will pass the test. She must feel comfortable taking the test again when spring comes along.,1
10591,"The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  ",1
9799,"She feels very connected  to this hibiscus plant because it renind her of her homeland.I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows it’s inner budding she will to. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seen has to care out to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it  she needs to comes out and melt all of her had habits and get what she meads to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left bedide. “…vowed silently to herself …then I will take that test again.’’       ",2

But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test she’ll be better prepared. ",1
10054,"The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. ",3
9170,"The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still “in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn’t yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. “I’m glad you got it,” Saeng’s mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saeng’s hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.",3

10101,"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng’s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, “then I will take that test again.“you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,”the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none.

9755,"Saeng promises herself that  “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.” The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.",1

9896,The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers.

9651,"The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don’t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.",1
10008,The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.,1
10315,The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has.,1
9863,The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will. So as you can see the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it.,1
10383,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph",1
10196,The author concludes this story with that paragraph because its show signs of hope and that knowing that spring will come again. For the family and that everything will be ok. For them also. The girl will makes friends also when spring comes.,1
9877,I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.,1
9312,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled “jasmine”, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is “not a real one” and she also says it’s “not like the kind we had before.” @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.",2
10255,It shows the importance of the  Hibiscus to Saeng and her dedication to the flower. It is also stating that she will wait for next spring to admire the flower again.,0
10021,I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.,1
10175,The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you’ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people.,0
10024,"The author ends it with that because it shows that she won’t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.",1
9672,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.,1
9208,"I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. “it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” In this quote Saeng’s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests.",2
9206,"In the story “winter Hibiscus,” the author included important part at the end that saeng vowed. The reason why she said that is because when everything in her life starts up again she will love her life again, she will be alot happier person.",1
10540,"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. ",2
9166,"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society.",2
9115,"The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower",2
9974,"I think that this is about winter hiliscus and hedpe tall and lush bad surrounded their garden its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. ",0

9488,The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. ,0
9080,"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower.",1
9385,"The author concludes this story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future.",1
9650,"At the end of the short start “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng says “when they comeback, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start “plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. “She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. So she wont now other.  ",2
9570,"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.",2
9928,"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again.  The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong through out their struggles. ",3
9357,"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn’t either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.",2
10005,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story.",1
10326,The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don’t won’t to let go but they knew there be back soon. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph.,1
9024,"I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace. The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus.",1
10257,"When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you don’t have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.",2

9430,"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng’s mother states, ""…it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…. That’s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months.",3
10140,The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.,1
9386,"The author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things.",2
9798,"The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.",2
9152,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great.",2

9920,"The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive’s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, “I-I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.",2
9452,"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn’t give up.",2
9972,"Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother’s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.",1

9699,"The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were “strange before [and] had become familiar to her now”. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.",2
9884,"The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the “metaphor” compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.

10614,"The story of “Winter Hibiscus” is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng’s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.” I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.",3
8954,"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better.

Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph.",1
10176,The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.,1
10509,One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.,1
10478,I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding.,0
9627,I think the author includes this because she doesn’t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don’t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.,2
9759,The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. ,2
10004,"Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.",3
8990,"There are many reasons wht the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness and seing fact ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test"" this quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failled a very important test and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familier plant"" is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother also sees delinlted. "" where did you get it?"" her mother aasked, and Saeng replied ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on it was clear to her mother the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter and endyat the plant with have as well I remember a time upon my mother bought me a work-candle cat desdion. I felt it was a waist of money, but when @CAPS1 saw her light delights for I it with love as well.

10011,In the story “Winter Hibiscus” which was wrote by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can change things and make things better.,1
9909,"It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn’t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.

(“Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world”) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden.

9644,"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph.",0
10463,The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and won’t give up and will do anything to pass it.,1
9461,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more.

Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending.,1

She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that’s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph..",1
9963,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again”. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.",2
9218,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that shes going to take the test again and try. Shes going to be like the flowers but she needs time so when they budd she will.,1
9078,"Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew that she can do much better than before. And she made a vowed to herself saying that once winter finally ends and spring start, she would take the test again, and this time she will pass it with flying colors.",1
10320,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. ",3
9337,The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how “Beautiful or calming” spring supposively is.,1
10032,"In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.” This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.",3
10321,"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she’s stating once everything “come back to life” then she’ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.",3
8979,"“When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The story “winter hibiscus” ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that’s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won’t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That’s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng’s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It’s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring.",3
10127,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It’s-it’s not a real one, ‘Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at’ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.” One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus.",3
9934,"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver’s test again, she will begin her new life.",2
9335,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.",1
9919,"The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng’s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles ‘seem so much more beautiful",3
9113,"The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test.    ",1
9317,"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence.",2

She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.",2
9844,The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.,2
9738,"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her.",2
9789,"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. “I mean it’s not like the kind we had at ? at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else.",2
9723,"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn’t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying “live in the moment”. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough.",3
9056,"The author didn’t think that Saeng was ready to take the test until she knew more about it. Saeng had a lot on her mind of gardening since she didn’t have any friends in school she didn’t want to go their the would have nobody to talk to its good that Saeng vowed because she will never know if she would do good or bad, So the author realized that Saeng will take the test and pass.",0
9502,The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.,1
9026,The reason why I feel the authour ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the charater has matured and how the charater grew in her circumstance. This shows that because you failed once doesn’t mean your going to fail again. Also it’s okay to feel out of place there is alway going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways but the decision is always up to you.,2
10298,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” probably chose to end the story that way because then it’s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.",3
10447,"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test.",2

One being that she is still uncomfor table about talking about her old home ‘’She was still to make to say the words at home’’ [HO] so the snow melting the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. Second remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng   says ‘’ Just as she known it would feel… ’’ Back home it Just grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs’’ [HO].So with reminder of her home she is give both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, w hen she is confident and strong.

9804,"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.",1

When she consoltes with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of america, even though she will always remember her homeland.",2
9248,"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho the aurthe concluldes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, “Look how root - bound it is, poor thing"". The example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I-I failed the test"". The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So In @CAPS1 the flower was at it's “breaking point"" as well as saeng.

10346,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home.",1

So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph.

10093,"The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story “the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair.” you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, “it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her “@CAPS1 Malik” flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  ",2
8942,I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.,1
9998,"When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus.

Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased",0
9249,"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better.",2

With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can’t let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time.",2
9939,The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task,2
9002,The author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. it is the last sentence because @CAPS1  fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and your at the end of the line you can always hope for the better when spring comes so will a new beginning not only saeng’s plant but also for her life in a different country.,2
9702,The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better.

10002,"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It’s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, “Not like the kind we had before,” this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,",2

In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasn’t given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you don’t know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.",2

The daughter suddenly relizes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She relates the flower and geese to herself.

Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she’ll go back and she’ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story.

10523,"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.",2
9042,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back.

Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   ",2

Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1).",2
9207,The author in @LOCATION1 this because it is shows what is is going to do to he her gain failed and this story a what she must do get just from the geese,0
10013,"I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become….. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.",2
10590,"I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isn’t a quiter. Saeng can’t wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back she’ll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it.",1
9829,"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild,” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return,” because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver’s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and knows it’s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng’s character.  ",3
10068,"The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not “at home,” that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway’s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.",3
9744,"In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   ",3

Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning.

She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States.

9441,"The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in enviroment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's likes the Hibiscus. She’s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it’s used to being free. But once it’s planted, it will become a part of it's surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.",3
9914,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author’s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng’s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. “it was like walking into another world,” said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.  ",3
10539,"The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver’s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence.",3
9285,"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved",2
10428,"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng @CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing..",2
10476,They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.,1

Letting the readers know that the nature will continue, The season will come back around.",0
9413,Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them growing unique.,0
8877,Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and there comparisions and differences and it talks abouts different buddings like when you get your mids your nuggets and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some nice @CAPS1.,0
10318,"The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.",2
9633,"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.",1
10477,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on.",3
9292,"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  ",3
9478,"The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. “I-I failed the test,” Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. “She was still too shaky to say at home” she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.”  ",2
10252,She said that because she was more intrested in flowers tha a test.,0
9763,"The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.",0
10132,"I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character ” Saeng” is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver’s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.",3
9363," The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.",2
9724,In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment.,3
9501,"“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say “I mean, not like the kind we had at home.” without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.",2
10201,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show thatshe will do this once she  has gotten use to the change of her new country. When she says, “When the geese return” their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.",2
8879,"I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she is reminded of home. I believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, “Not like the kind we had before.” This suggest to me that she was probably home sick. Then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test. This is why I believe the author ended with this paragraph.",2
9324,I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.,0
8998,I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.,3
10035,"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(""again"")!.",0
8918,The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.,1
10365,"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion.",0
10554,"The author includes the exccept at the end for a meaning reason to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she. Which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower bloomability.",2
9532,The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.,1
9223,"After reading the about story, “Winter Hibiscus “ by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, “when they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus the budding, then  I will take that test again.” Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it state that “Saeng day out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it”. This shows that this plant areas a lot to here. The story tell the readon that it things lack memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had which push here to try to overcome the loss betters. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it about Saeng will for hope and peace. It represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness.",2
10618,"The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relasonship between saeng and the habiscas, and how much just seeing it feels.

9123,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her hole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she “vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.” @CAPS1 meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could had done.",1

From when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. “She closed her eyes and breathed. in, deeply Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair....” This made her very imotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her.",1

9110,"From the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng vowed silently because it is to show Saeng’s determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, that was closly resembled the one at “home,” to symbolize her conformt. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. “through the quiet repetiton of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she reconignzed the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, “like the Geese she lifited her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,"" and this explains that there is still hope inside of her. This paragraph conclusion the author had concluded ties together what Saeng is now hoping and believing in.",2

9278,The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potintal of the hibiscus. So Saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed.

10364,"“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”",1

Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will.

When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”.

Saeng struggled to get out “I-I failed the test” and couldn’t say “at home” this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.,2
10390,The author include the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up. and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her home land and it will help her. For example Saeng started to cry because she miss her homeland.,1
10080,"The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said “its not like the one at home.” That’s why the author concludes this paragraph.",1
9520,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.",1
9902,She said that she was going to take the test agen because to show her mom that she can do it and Past it this time. instad of worring over her old home.,1
8972,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.",2
9620,I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.,1
9295,"This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sigh of hope and so is spring, this makes the en time thing be fkor, without this part the story would be a sad one, but with it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot. It is on resa lution without a resolution.",2
10379,"Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and ?yes- familiar to Saeng now.” Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and “@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended “Winter Hibiscus” with the particular paragraph.",3
9085,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver’s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ??? (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)",2
10512,"The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can’t be stubborn. So Saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. By the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test",1
10240,The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.,1
9126,The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he didn’t finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense. This was a well written story and conclusion.  ,1
9407,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that’s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                ",2
10620,"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.",2
8904,"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says ‘’A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden…’’ @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says,’’ Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,’’ @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     ",2
9303,I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what.,1
9302,"“When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don’t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn’t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.",1
9517,The reason  why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding.,1
8910,The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.,1
10023,"Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That’s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test.",1
9185,"The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. So say that if at first you don’t sucede, try try again.

Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested.",2

9725,The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe ‘the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.,1
9674,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, “… she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes”[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, “…she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac”[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, “…she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now “[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.",3
9777,"Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     ",2

Saeng wishes that she way in her homeland, and keeps up reffiring to it because she wants it back. “I mean, it’s not like the one we had at-at-,” Saeng continues to stumble because she doesn’t wish to mention home because it brought her to tears. In addition, were she mentions the “test”, it makes to her buyin a fake test.“It’s - it’s not a real one”. She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is. The test reffs to both the plant and the driver’s test. Saeng also ends with this vow because the flower represent hope to her, ""... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test”. The emotions test of both of the situations she is is will allow her to be stronger. This vow at the end of the story shows her willing up to be strong and come through in the end.",3

It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test ‘She said, “I?I failed the test.” By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good.

9618,"The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver’s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. “Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,”, “The winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now”, and, “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and ? yes ? Familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange.

Almost as if she doesn’t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  ",2

Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.",0
9806,The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season’s that they bud.

9581,The author concluded the story with this sentence because shes letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school.,0
9709,"I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.” @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go.

Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. ",3
9979,"I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test.

Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.",2

The mother think jst because she keep failing the test because of her connection to her past expeirences or effection for her new country. and ability to overcome obstacles ar finally I think she is comforted by memories or her homland..,1
10607,"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.",1
9523,"In the concluding statement Saeng states that “when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home.",3
10206,The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/@CAPS1 put that in the story; @CAPS2/@CAPS3 it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up.,0
9891,The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.,1

I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.",2
10253,I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it.So therefore  in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom.,1
9482,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads “And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” This excerpt demonstrates Saeng’s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news “I-I failed the test” @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng’s source of stength as it’s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter.",2
9175,"The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn’t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng’s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    ",3
9893,"By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story “winter Hibiscus,“ the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying “ I will take that test again,” the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.",2
8870,I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.,2
9648,"The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story’s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, “when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story’s themes.",3
10561,Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better.,1
9624,"The author concludes the story with when they come back …”to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, “walking into another world.” As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the “familiar fragrance “which “filled her lungs .” It was even difficult for saeng to say the words “at home” without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.  ",3
8988,"The author ends the story in this way because the plant and leaving of the geese represent change to Saeng. The hibiscus isn't the same as she remembers from back home. The budding of the hibiscus shows Saeng's happiness from home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng courage and the ability to overcome her obstacle. The geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time. The plant will budd at the time the geese return in the spring. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full effect of memories for Saeng wouldn't have been fully portrayed. This line implies that Saeng was unable to overcome her obstacle because of the newness of this place. when the budds bring her a sense of home, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test. She will be more confident.",2
10457,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It makes people want to read the next story to see How she close on a the test. In the story she failed the test now that she changed she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @PERSON1 now than before.,1
9870,Reserved need to check keenly,3
9082,The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.,2
10022,She see if her plant will survive then the winter just like the ones back at home.. And she things will be the. Same.,1

After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time.

10085,"I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”.

Saeng’s mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese “sound familiar.” As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she’s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it.

The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng’s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States.

Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, “it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.” Saeng’s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng’s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world.",3
10511,"The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng’s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen",1
10040,"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"".

For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world.

As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to “start over” again or to “try again”. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to “start life” again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.",3

9039,"The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn’t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again.

8909,"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past.",2
10546,"In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story it mentions that in her past childhood she had seen the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. It shows that she was disapointed because in the story it say that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astionished, and yelled at her for a second.

10564,"The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, “Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world” (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her “(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also.

All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.",3
9846,"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.",2
9163,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn’t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.",2
10096,Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.,1
10459,I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.,0
10537,I think he put this in here because. I think he’s trying to say when the snow melts just forget bout the first time. And when the geese return it your @NUM1 chance. Then the hibiscus budding is you get passed what you were trying to do.,1
9031,"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything.

Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were she’s gone from.

9832,"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.",2
10380,"The author concludes the story in winter hibiscus, Kind of funny/ weird like . The concluding sentence is ‘when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself in the  spring, when  the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.,0
10050,"The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says “when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.” The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.",2
10250,"I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word “test”, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.",2
10345,The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life.

For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home ? In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.",2
9161,"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.",3
10367,"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author ‘write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  ",2
10473,"In the end of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator describes her desire to take and this time pass the driver's test she failed earlier in the day, she ""vowed silently to herself"" that she would succeed at something she had failed at in the past. This is an important concluding message, because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future. Most of the story is about the sadness that the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland. She is also not enjoying @LOCATION2, because she has already experienced failure at her new home. However, the end of the story provides contrast do this, for Saeng vows to succeed in the future.       ",3
10413,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like say most of the story but in a small and shorter way.,0
9826,"The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng’s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom’s gardening, she says, “Here, let me help, mother,” because her mom’s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” which shows Saeng’s concern for her mother’s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng’s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story’s conclusion.",1

9470,"From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.",2
10574,"The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning she’s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I’ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I’m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.   ",0
9354,"Saeng failed her driver’s test at the beginning of the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She sates, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long grey hair.” The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, “??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make through the cold months.” She’s trying to make her daughter feel better. It states, “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their fault honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.”",2
9402,"Including the bit about taking the test again when the “hidiscus is budding” provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn’t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus.",3
9942,"The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.",3
10123,Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it showed a restated the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.,0

9750,In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  ,3
9241,I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers known that Saeng is a survivor just like hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to america and feels that this plant reminds her of home,1
10465,"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time.",2

She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds.",0
10374,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across. also because she wanted to create an under standing of the complexitier of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it.,0

Also to show the readers that the characters characteristics couldn’t be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it untill she does what she has to do.,1
10489,"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful.",0
9318,The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus canre seed and go threw everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process. ,0
8950,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.",1
9036,"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason.",0
10259,"The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says “Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, “It’s a beautiful plant” to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.",1
9515,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are “familiar to Saeng now “ despite her thinking of them as “strange before.” The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng’s vow that she will “take that test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt…”etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng’s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author’s wording was very well done.",3
9083,"Minfong Ho ended her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optomistic sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope. Saeng decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was blooming. This flower reminds her of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb"". She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers in @LOCATION2. She was goint to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so she can feel more comfortable and happy. The author wanted to end it so Saeng would be happy. ",2
9588,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn’t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.",2
9418,"I think the reason why the author ended the story with this “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” paragraph because like this the plant didn’t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.",1
9931,I believe the author ended the story with the “test” because it is a big part of Saeng’s life or part of her tradition.,1
9694,I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.,1
9981," In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected.",3
9748,"The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away.",2
9541,"The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver’s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.",3

From the story ""winter' Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right.",1

For example in the “@CAPS1’s @ORGANIZATION1"" the main character @PERSON1 run away and all are could get as a slaming door. Much live in this story there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she goig to try to move ww friends? is this live a resolution she is making to herself? also this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they @MONTH1 go back and even read it again.",1

It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver’s test.

8934,The author is saying that she’s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.,1
10616,"Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.",2
9785,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.",1
9802,"The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready",1
8930,In this story Saeng shows her mother how pasionate she is with planting and her pasionate for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show how the charact Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says “I will try this test again” meaning that if she is doing something that she enjoys doing then she will try it again and again until she is fully pleased.,0
9106,"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass.",3
10099,I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.,2
9192,"Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.",1
10027,"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That’s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  ",2
9379,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do.",2
9676,He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that’s tuff. ,1
8898,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don’t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.",2
9703,She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.,0
9669,"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does",3
10313,The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower ,0
9659,In the story “ Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.,3
9189,I think the author includes this paragraph  in  the  story  because  it  makes  sence  the  geese  come  back  home  after  the  snow  melts  and  saeng  try’s  to  take  her  test  again  around  that  time.,1
9991,"This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her.",3
10194,"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now.",1
9383,"The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says “I mean, not like the kind we had at?at-”, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.” She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland.",1
8964,The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around.,0
9689,"She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.",2
9072,The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes ,0
9013,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.",1
9124,"well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.",0
10460,The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together.,0
9944,"Because the Winter hibiscus"" was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it. overhead, a flock of canada greese flow by, their faint honks clear and -Yes- @CAPS1 to Saeng now. ",0
8992,the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and that’s why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.,0
8880,The arthur uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now shes ready and that’s what the arthur wanted the reader to figure out.,1
10424,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.",2
9575,"The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing. In conclusion they one the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.",1
9977,The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.,0
9958,"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  ",3
9043,"The last paragraph states “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.",2
9941,The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.,1
8932,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.,1
9589,"The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see’s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a “You what?” hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.",2
9266,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Forexample, It gives the Story a good and happe ending.",1
9178,"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in saeng’s heart and attitude toward her new life in @LOCATION1 spring symbolize rebirth, the author doesn’t include this on accident. Spring will be saeng’s time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in @LOCATION1.”When the snow melts”is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snows melt a way so will saeng fears. ",2
10391,I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. I think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time,1
9901,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it’ll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she’ll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again she’ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she’ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.,2
9568,The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.,0
10113,"I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.",1
9261,The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country.,1
9384,The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. ,1
8915,"I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She’s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it’s to miss or a misake. For an example “they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.",2
10491,He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.,2
8867,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, “Winter Hibiscus”, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that @PERSON1 will past the test. Her mother will be proud of her. Also, Saeng will start to become a customed to her new country and her new surrounding and stopremenising about her life back in Vietnam.",2
10630,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.",2
9552,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng’s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she’s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.”",2
10553,"The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can over come something if you have the will power. Saeng failed the first test. She bought a plant that reminds her of home. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground. She realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life. She decided to retake the test. Saeng realized that even though you @MONTH1 fail once you have to keep trying if it is what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on. Finally Saeng realized that good things can over come bad. After she failed the test she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summerizes the story perfectly.",2
9229,"In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says “but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.",2
9629,"The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said “saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.” So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.",0
10017,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it’s saying that she can’t work in the garden in winter, but “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,“ are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden.",0
9720,The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is how the story started with Saeng failing the test to how the story endend with saeng planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the whole story.,1
10272,"to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says “when they come back”. also when she says “the geese return & this hibiscus is budding”. Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says “, Then I will take that test again”.",1
8897,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that’s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.",1
9504,"The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.",2
9534,"The  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says,”…when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again”(No @NUM1).In spring when all of these events take place. Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are “renewed” in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.",3
9612,The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.,0
8902,"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  ",3
9923,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.,1
9069,"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn’t full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding” The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn’t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought.",3
10128,"The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn’t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.",1
8980,"I think the author concludes the story with that Paragraph because the hibiscus makes them over come obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can @CAPS1 to her mum that she can past it. I also, think that because the hibiscus gives them strenghth and she got more confident in herself to past the test.",1
9353,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, I think that the author concludes the story in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again” because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story",2
9358,"The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two inpefect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the gese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.",0
9144,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her. ” Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.",1
8945,"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.",2
8875,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph,1
10214,"At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.",2
9858,"The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.",1
9770,"The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter",1
9284,Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.,1
9704,"Saeng vowed siletly to herself ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her mind went of the track from think about a flower. She says "" One of the blossoms had fallen off"" then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. it happ distracted her mind. Her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. Her never got mad. All she did was brushing the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus"" into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. She sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. The intro says ""Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. it never mentioned about her family""",1
10341,He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right.,1
9298,"The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver’s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again",2
10549,In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume thats what its talking about with it.,1
9760,"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”",2
9706,Thes basically say that he will be around again just like the geese always come back.,0
10577,In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.,1
8892,"The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from alot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she wont take the test again the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen.",1
9352,"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give You an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself so this paragraph made her sound like she was sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do.",2
9017,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope. She believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal, in the spring. In the spring the geese will return and the hibiscus will be budding. This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved. Also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope.",2
10180,"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story because as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.",0
10526,"The author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. Because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. ",2
9765,The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land comforting her and motovating her. She says when those things come back she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself.  As most people try to do,1
10212,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it,1
10112,The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.,1
10557,The author choses to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng got the plant to remind her of her homeland and cheer her up. Once the plant is bloomed she feels like she would as well and be ready for the test.,2
9764,The reason the author of “Winter hibiscus” ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.,2
10278,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to know that she will regain her confidence when the ""hibiscus is budding"" and take another slot at the driving test. He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy.",2
10373,"I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that’s why he ends like that.",1
9722,"The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.",2
9492,I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn’t it for the little girl and she wasn’t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn’t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn’t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.,0
9838,"The author probably conclude the story with that paragraph b/c she is basically relating the plants to herself meaning as the plant bloom she will too by taking the test. and her reason could be b/c or is b/c reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclde the story...because she was comparing herself ib the geese and does as they did ",2
10496,"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.",1
8899,"The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she’s happy now. So she’s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she’s to do all over again.",0
9091,"In “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn’t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. “Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.” This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.",2
9406,"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she’s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,….” So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.",0
9960,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.,1
10037,"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and fails the drivers test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, The ending paragraph, ""who troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the Geese we ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud so will she and she will take to drivers test again.",2
9480,I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.,1
8976,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn’t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.,0
10502,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again. So in my opinion the author wants to show the readers that the character in story cares a lot about the natures baety.,1
10469,I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass. Sh is studying for it in the mean time.,1
9653,The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one.,0
9254,"Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won’t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  “A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye…”(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states “it’s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it”(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states “and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   ",3
10484,"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.",2
9316,"The author concluded the story with the paragraph ”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn’t be their best during winter begun to thrive, she will too. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she’ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She’ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow’ s done melting, and when she’s done crying like the snow’s done melting, and when she’s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she’ll be ready to take the test.",3
9586,The author concludes this paragraph in the story because thats when she starts growing plants again & she wants to start over again,1
10611,"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.",1
9139,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.",1
9280,There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it’s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.,1
9454,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”",0
9122,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”.",2
9897,I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it’s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it’s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.,1
9795,"I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she’s grew up more and maybe she’ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. “hibiscus is budding” this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.",2
10020,"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng’s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng’s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.",2
9767,"Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized ? all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.",2
9004,"I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won’t give up. “Saeng  vowed silently to herself, “I will take that test again”, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.",3
8961,"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas.",1
9643,"The author ends the story with  “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. “ A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.      ",2
10234,"The author conclude the story with her saying in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. to say the she will not gust out like that.",1
10453,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see’s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt.",2
9995,The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won’t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.,2
9640,"I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.",2
8926,The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back,1
9984,The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.,1

She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn’t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.",2
10403,I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn’t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn’t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn’t physicaly and mentally prepared for it. ,1
9566,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.",1
10142,"She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she’ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.",3
9562,"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam",3
9235,"The author ended that story like that because that’s  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.",1

9937,"The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it’s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matter” (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng’s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, “not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt.

Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment.

It was hard for her to say her country’s home without crying. ""It’s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home.

9926,The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well.

She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.",2
10178,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was saying that if it is possible for these things to happen then she should be able to take the test and pass it. She was comparing things together that she knew that do noot go together. For example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over. She meant that if the thing she likes the most overcomes its obstacle then she would do what hurted her the most over again. She doesn’t know if she takes the test over she would keep trying over and over until she passes it. In the story she doesn’t know to fit in. All she knows is what she learned in her country . All she have to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass his test .,2

When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready.",3
9046,"The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he’s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again",1
9498,"I belive the author used these lines in the last paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 he realy liked it.",0
10545,"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.",3
8941,"The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng’s obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her driver’s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , “I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng,”… but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter “[@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus’ job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, “… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”[@NUM2]. If Saeng’s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver’s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes it’s “test” , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.",3
9147,"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life.

10513,"The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will “bud” too and gain her license.",1
10411,"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  ",3

The paragraph says” When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. ""The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything like the flower and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test.

The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.” She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others",2

10314,"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test.

",1
8908,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. First example when “Saeng vowed silently to herself” it shows how she respect and miss her homeland. It tells that she want to try again about her failure in the past. The last example when she want to overcome her failure in the past. The last line of the paragraph say “then I will take that test again”. It says she want another. Chance on her life. These are the example of the author concludes the story with this paragraph.,1
10354,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, “When they come back…then I will take that test again.” She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  ",2

The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait till winter end so she see the hibiscus is budding.",2
10300,I think that in the story “Winter Hibiscus” was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end “I will take the test again” so you don’t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.,1
10504,"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   ",3
9472,"The author finished off the story with that paragraph because the paragraph is saying that overtime when she is adapted well to every thing she will be able to take the test, so that’s why she says “…and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,…” “@CAPS1 that all it needs is time. Time to get warm and time to grow. Also the paragraph is well thought out and relates to the entire story. So she concluded with a great paragraph that made a lot of sense in relationship with the story.",1

For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver’s test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   ",2
9656,The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.,1
10458,Cause every thing that is in this paragraph is in the story somewere. So it really intwines to gether. She learns to adapt to her new home land as dose the plant.  ,1
9424,The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn’t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.,0
9380,"Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. ",2

10116,The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.,0
9074,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.” The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once “this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again” because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver’s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.",3
10530,"The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.",2
10036,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.,1

9823,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  ,1
9395,The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.,1
9224,"“Winter Hibiscus”, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her drivers test and was dissapointed as she walked home. She stops at a florist shop because she see's a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home. Seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland. She plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again. When the geese get back. The plant is like encouragment to her.",2
10003,The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.,2
10098,"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, she gains more confidence because she leds like she’s back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.",2

9219,"In the story “winter hibiscus “by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring.

9766,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again...

In conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy.",2
9448,"This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again.

This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again.

She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner’s permit test.

9037,"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes his story with an odd ending. “’when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself,’in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.’” I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver’s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..” I believe that this is showing that she still didn’t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       ",3

She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass",3

When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages",3
10218,"Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.",1
9528,The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.,0
9416,"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perserverance. For example, the story was baised around the winter hibscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will perserveer and take her test again and the hibiscus perserveers and forges through the winter not allowing itself to die. Another example that @CAPS1 mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because her stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done, she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test agin. But she did not, she said she was going to try again. ",3
10344,"In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she’s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says “I ? I failed the test” this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn’t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying” When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she’s determined to strive under difficult conditions.",2
8889,"I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.",1
9429,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states “when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.",2
8999,The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.,1
9971,I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom,1
9792, The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do. it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.,2
8882,I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to. Also the hibiscus will be budding in the wild just like back home,1
8896,"The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng’s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future.",2
9199,"It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.    ",3
10135,The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - Saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers I guess because it remaind of in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.,2
9451,"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test",1
9304,"The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.",3
10601,The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again.” because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing “the test.”,1
10635,"She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.",2
10392,"The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. “The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the story’s message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.",3
10517,"The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng’s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.",2
10409,"The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. “Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.” Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story “winter hibiscus” means.",3
9773,"The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.",1
9344,"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things",0
10498,"The last paragraph in, ‘’Winter Hibiscus,’’ was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    ",2
9038,"The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that saeng wont stop, just because she faild one first time. It also shows that she is not going to let certaint things keep her down.",1
9060,"In the story “ Winter Hibiscus “ Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. “Almost  familiar to her now.” This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.",3
10171,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melt and the geese return, then she can do as the hibiscus be strong and won’t give up on her test.",1
9200,The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. ,1
9347,This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng’s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.,2
9336,"The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It’s almost as if she’s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng “realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she’ll have a different outlook on her new life.",2
10566,In the quote above it is telling that saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to.,1
9820,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, “hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver’s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, “in the spring… I will take the test @NUM3). This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope.",3
8967,"I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it.",2
9989,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.,1
9263,"In the story ‘’Winter Hibiscus,‘’ the author ends the story with Saeng ‘s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn’t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place.In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in @LOCATION2. This would make her feel strong and focused. ",3
9753,"I think Minfong Ho concluded her story “Winter Hibiscus” the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would’ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that “Winter Hibiscus” was concluded in this way.",2
9277,"If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that’s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always “hear” that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that’s why he concluded the story as such. ",2
9957,"After reading ”Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn’t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end “Winter Hibiscus”, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.",2
10343,"In “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1 sentence is “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable",1
8871,The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.,1
9322,I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want’s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.,0
9173,When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.,0
10451,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn’t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn’t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.",2
9975,"The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (WORDS NOT @CAPS2) ",2
9542,he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.,1
9869,She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. ,1
9875,"In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a “touching” affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, that’s why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story.",2
8987,The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.,2
10406,"I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.",1
9239,"The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time.",2
10613,"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she.",2
9421,"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn’t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng’s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.",1
9867,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice paragraph. So she needs to take that test again.",0
10222,"The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she’s no longer to do anymore.",0
10120,"THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS “THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.”, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY.",2
9815,"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.",1

I really like the part when she says ""…in the spring, when the snows melt…."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it.",1
10288,"This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver’s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.",0

Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.,1
10429,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...” the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.” The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ‘@CAPS1, Saeng said.’ “After failing her driver’s test, walking into the florist’s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  ",3
10055,The author chose to conclude the story like that because she?€™s saying that it isn?€™t over and she?€™s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says ?€œI- I failed the test?€?so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.,1
9275,The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.,1
10059,"In the story “the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example “when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again”, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way.",1
9169,"I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn’t melt in the spring geese don’t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    ",0
10624,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesn’t want to disappoint herself. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.,1
9098,"The author chose to conclude the paragraph with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it shows how the strenghth of the hibiscus is related to Saeng's strenghth. In the story, after failing her drivers test, Saeng @CAPS1 comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. when she gets home her mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This shows that saeng is faltiering in her new foriegn country. The end quote sums up that saeng @CAPS1 strenghth in the strenghth of the flowers. almost thinking if flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I?""",3
10029,The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.,1
9242,"The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming",1
9006,"I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece.",3
9314,This paragraph @NUM1 includes to let the reader know it's winter. you know its winter because in the passage its says when the snow melt.,0
10191,"The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. “But how could you? You know how much we?what happened?” when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother’s inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again.",2
9557,In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it’s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.  ,1
9216,"In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.” This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past.",1
9182,The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding.,2
9861,"The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn’t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   ",3
9153,"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden graw. You know this because it says “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn’t grow, she wanted to try again. That’s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring.",2
9133,"The last paragraph of the “Winter Hibiscus” reads “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees “plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. “The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails “the test” by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is “almost familiar to her now,” such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.",2
10393,The story is about he failing the test. She says she will try next year when the geese come back.,1
10499,The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did.,1
8874,I think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what I think I take the test again means.,0
9932,"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.",2
10395,"I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it’s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own.",3
9686,The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don’t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.,1
10625,"I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.",1
9154,The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the “winter hibiscus” and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.,1
9361,"In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states “ its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus”. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did.",2
9256,"The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesn’t  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of ,” don’t  give  up.”",2
9571,"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it’s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng’s thought’s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng‘s eyes now and swept over her “and” in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.” This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it’s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” It means that she will overcome all that and move on.",3
9264,"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph.",3
9776,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. ",1
9496,"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY.",0
10595," The author of “Winter Hibiscus” decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it. ",3
9155,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything.,0
9149,"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  ",2
9188,"The author concludes the story with, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It’s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.",3
10619,"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.",2
10254,The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  ,0
9603,"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, “It’s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can’t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test.",2
10514,I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.,0
9840,"She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.",0
8922,"I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a “test” and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real “home” that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say “home” without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.",2
9274,In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.,2
9228,"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng won’t give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didn’t really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph",2
9768,In the story winter Hibiscus Saeng is fond of Beautiful flowers that once grew in her home land. Her favirte flower was the winter Hibiscus that had beautiful red pedals on it as of velvet. She also failed a test that she had taken so what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as whats at home but sometimes you just need another chance at something.,1
9455,The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.,0
9508,"Many authors end their storys in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a saying One reason she ended her story this way was she kinda revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end it says “I will take that test again.” This lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng but it is when she takes the test again. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful but will try again. This is show when the author said “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” see she said this hibiscus which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writings techniques and hints we might not know if there will be a sequal and what might happen.",2
10223,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn’t like the change and would like to go back to her old home,2
9687,"I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said “she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre”. And that’s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  ",1
9582,The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the flower is told about all through the story and the author puts when the hubiscius is budding then I will take that test again.,0
9329,"The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.",3
9198,"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story “Winter Hibiscus” on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They’ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, “why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags” which is the mother’s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. “Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.",2
10301,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and gives you pointes or some events in the story you din’t know about.",0
9112,"The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. she says, “Here let me help you mother.” This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.” This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn’t think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes that statement.",2
10430,"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is sayinG that when the year starts OFF @CAPS2 and starts over, that she will too. She's sayinG that when the Geese @CAPS3 back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a @CAPS2 beGiNNiNG. So when she Goes to take the test it will be a @CAPS2 year.",2
10586,"The author concluded the story in such a way that the reader’s eyes are opened. It shows the reader that dispite what @MONTH1 happen, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, there’s always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all.",1
10632,The author concludes the story with that paragraph so the reader has something to think about.When the author concludes with something like that he/she wants the reader to make there own ending or pridicshon. And some times it means a sequel.,1
9855,"I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver’s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.",2
10567,"I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn’t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. ”In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.” ",0
9184,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   ",1
10642,There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart. But It seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.,2
8982,"The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test.",1
10535,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       ,0
9138,"The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about over coming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of “home”. Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldn’t have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng has almost this internal war with her-self and the author ends the story that way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.",3
9606,"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, “I know"", her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It’s flower aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way.",2
9061,"The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,”I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.”it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!",3
9817,"When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author’s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she’s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland",1
10213,"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn’t given up on her driving test",1

She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind. I think that the reason why the author choose to put the paragraph in the end of the story. ",1
10247,"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.",1
10441,The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.,2
10472,He concludes the story like thot because the test was the main thing thot he was talking about.,0
9389,"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.” The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why “and the geese return.” is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you “plant” yourself you can thrive with confidence. ",3
9678,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. For example in the story she made it obvious she cared more about the garden then school.,0

10045,With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her. Of her old homeland. The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.  ,0
10312,"I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant.",0
9684,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, “then I will take that test again.” Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.",1
9638,"The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn’t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don’t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don’t want to, it doesn’t mean you can’t go on.",2

9714,"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests”. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that’s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys.",2
10028,"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter.",1
10291,"The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.",2
9489,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng’s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn’t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says “will take that test again”she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.,2
9982,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says “this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn’t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling hostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance.",2
8956,The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming.,1
9752,"I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past",1
9851,Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.,1
10450,"The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng’s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.",3
10636,The author ended the story with that paragraph to let the readers know that she did not give up. In the story it seem like she had thoughts of giving up but her thoughts of her homeland comforted her when she thoughts she was going to give up. But the last paragraph of the story she confirmed that she wasn’t giving up.,1
9608,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,’’ I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place.",3
9667,"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.",2
8952,"The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing.

The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says “almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become” This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes they’ll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. ",3
10363,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.,1
9040,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well.

When the closing sentences states that Saeng “vowed” to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. “Winter Hibiscus” is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life.

8873,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn’t like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldn’t just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again.

9824,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.",2
9374, The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn’t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother,1
10147,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say “when they come back” talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.,1
9362,"The concluding paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus “portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring . this is obvious shown it states  “in the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding . she accepts this as a new chance to start fresh , and then try to pass the test. The change from winter  to spring symbolize saeng’s hardship  of flying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese   return and the hibiscus is  adapting in its new environment is the symbol by which saeng  follows as it is from her old home in Vietnam, but can now  also prosper elsewhere. ",3
9377,I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won’t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it’s not quite as cold.,1
9088,"The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archotyal season. It is a season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus after she failed the first test. It took her to her memories back in Vietnam, which comforted here she believes that maybe when she sees the plant florishing and she geese returning, she will experience that same revival again.",2
9898,"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings.What I mean by this is,the hibiscus represents new beginnings.She says “When the hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.This will be a new start for her  .The plant  blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother.She’s saying by the time the spring comes around she  would be ready for a  new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant.",2
10007,"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepare for this test, because she was not accustom to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that the spring time is when more will blossom, she will be ready to take the test over.",1
9468,I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver’s test. Before she made that move she was dishearted because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between them and the spring time ,1
9260,"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her.",3
9600,"The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author era’s with is used to show @CAPS1 life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.",2
8878,He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.,1
9408,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn’t ready, and she didn’t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before.",0
10190,"The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next. Using this is effective because you know what has happened and It make the reader wonder if she  fails or succeeds the next time around.",1
9927,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a “V” so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.",3
9708,"By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, “in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author’s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.",2
9573,The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.,2
9943,The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew.

10187,"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered.",2
8970,"To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing “now.” The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.",1
8957,"The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance.

9398,"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.",1

She wen’t and took a test for a flower and she did not pass and she went back sad and emoshond she told her grandmother that these flowers are not like the ones at-at she cold not say at home because it took too much pain and her grandmother said they are not like the real wones.,1

After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn’t want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.",3
10165,"The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time.",1
10118,"The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this “test” once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.",2

9237,"Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral ”(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.  ",2
9269,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng’s problem is her “wave of loss” that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng’s depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph.",2
8958,She concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She says “when the snow melts”. She wants to look at the events again. and take care of them.,0
10515," The author used the paragraph telling about how saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because,the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the u.s. When Saeng says,”and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again” she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things.",2
9287,"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. It shows that even though she failed it once she isn’t going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. It shows that she doesn’t regret buying the hibiscus.  ",2
10560,The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn’t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.,1
10468,The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. ,1
9652,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says,” I I failed the test,” meaning saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn it real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She’s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,”saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,” meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.

10264,"The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters. “Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they “died” as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.",3
10276,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again. The first example show that she was sad that she fail the test. At the conclusion the author put this statement in the story to show reader tat Saeng will pass the diver licenc test later on.,2
9071,"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     ",2
10404,"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things.",2
10593,They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again,0
10370,The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. “Not like the kind we had before “(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.,1
10041,"She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother got the plant, went home, and they started planting it. The daughter loved the plant very much. And she said that next year I’ll grew a plant as wonderful as the oh her mom was growing.",0
10200,"The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.",3
8923,"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     ",3
10598,Ii think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause the author is saying Its gonna be a @CAPS1 year or some change is gonna happen and he feels That could of did better than what they did and is gonna take that test again.,1
10056,I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.,1
9427,"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.",1
9359,The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focus to just keep her mind on the test & not the planting.,0
9734,"She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.",2
8953,The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  ,1
10285,@PERSON1 go to the top and then over the hill.,0
9751,"I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.",1
8886,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to snow that just because you fail once you  shouldn’t give up.  From  what  was  expressed  it  the  paragraph it  was  implied to me that Saeng  will become  stronger by spring and be able to pass the test .,1
10558,"The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. “When the geese come back … in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn’t die each season. It’s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.",2
8968,The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again.,2
10544,I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.,0
9023,It’s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscuss inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to saeng.,1
10089,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.",0
9018,"The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.",2
10399,"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes.",2
9782,"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn’t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say’s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.”",1
10435,"The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her.",1
9015,The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    ,1
8946,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng’s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story.",3

It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again.",2
9992,"The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. ",0
9626,I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on,0
9828,"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.",2
9094,Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter.,1
10090,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.",3
9561,"In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.",2
9205,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn’t like it because I didn’t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story.",1
10414,This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring. ,1
10486,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.,0
9426,"In “winter Hibiscus” the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.",2

9306,The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.,2
10640,"The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more.

In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng ? confidence, beauty, adaptation… some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again” it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)",3

This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home.

She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower.

9111,"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.",2
9440,"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.",1
9533,I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story ,1
9569,"It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driver’s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will “return” to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. “I paid nineteen dollars for  it”. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.",3
8881,"the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says “I-I failed the test.” She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to “take that test again."" @CAPS1, Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, “while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to “take the test again.” Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test “ when the snow melts and the geese return.” The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese.",3
10397,"There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year. ",3
9100,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.",1
9114,"The author concludes the “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though she’s in a new country, some things are still the same. So she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of are strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season familiar to her now.”  This quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain same. This also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it. The narrator also said, “Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.” This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the  of pressure to pass, and of a new is ready to pass the test. But she’ll be more prepared. The theme of this story could be seen things discourage you. The narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons.",3
10107,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the “winter hibiscus” and the geese. So the author just simply writes another concluding paragraph that just wraps the story up, and the reader walkes away with a feel good feeling.",1
9737,Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.,1
8929,"The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license.",1
10033,She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about,1
9203,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes beet to the way they were she will do everything agein so thins aren’t the same as they used to be and she wants them to.,0
9177,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say in over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before have become almost familiar which is an improvement.",1
8905,"I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn’t just going to give up, that her failing wasn’t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. “The hibiscus will be budding”   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try.",2
10325,"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal.",2
9210,I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.,1
9410,The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.,1
9683,"Minfong tto ended the story with aphrase dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho ). When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity. ",2
10231,"I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says “through the quiet repitition of season upon season” which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she’ll always be there, ready to “take the test”",1
9104,"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything.",2
10275,"Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, “she failed the test” probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather’s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said “then I will take that test again” @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.",2
10297,"In the story Saeng vowed silently to herself, “When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. For some reason I think that is affine idea Saeng vowed.",0
9343,The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that Saeng @CAPS1 gave up so you should'nt either. I think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is “@CAPS1 give up.” @CAPS2 even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.,1
10408,She can’t wait till the flowers start to come back when the snow melts so it isn’t very cold out so they grow and she is going to take her test that she has failed when the geese and flowers come back.,1
10088,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.",2
