18808,"Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit about being patient. (@NUM1) patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shoping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t then you could get into an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. (@NUM2) being patient is important. If you have kids your impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience.",12

19297,A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range. And if one does I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw. And I remember siting there being as patient as I could waiting for a deer to step within range. Then l hear the leaves cranching . The there it is the deer I’m going to shout?? How you draw it back. Than I shoot I could feel the arrow gliding throw my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer takes off. I wanted there in my tree stand ready to go blame my deer. Me and my dad traked it about soft and there it was. I was so excited that all yelled. It was nice to know that all my patients and hard work had payed of. Thank you for reading my story. Hope you enjoyed it.,19

19104,"My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt’s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt’s girlfriend two dollars.",21

19138,"There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist we got there and we sat down. Let me tell you something I hate the dentist. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don’t have to wait as long. That means you can get and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. Its like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and proffessional. If I were you go patient it leads you to a good future.",13

After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked ?€œhow long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down??€??€œabout five minutes.?€?@CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. ?€œhow long??€??€œsix now.?€?@CAPS3 wouldn?€™t have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. ?€œThe performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.?€?@CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over.

I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I’m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.",12

19360,"I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one.",18

18117,Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.,19

18450,"Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldn’t sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, “hi!” very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient.",20

18277,A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn’@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.,18

All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they don’t wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged.

18829,"A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasn’t ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn’t say nothing. I didn’t want to but I did. I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly then my sister yelled I want to go wait. I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes, so she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out and I said girl what’s wrong with your har suprised. She felt her head and said o I forgot. So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldn’t fit. So I let her do something and she couldn’t. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside. That’s a time when I waited paintently on my sister.",16

18107,"One thing I am not very at ient with is the meap. The reason I am not patient with the meap because it is very boring you can not talk and it is dull. I hate the meap it is very difficult, you don’t see tenn see or @CAPS1 doing the meap. The meap expect you to do to much work the meap is one of the reason I dislike michgan. The meap asking you questions and words you never saw or herd before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we are going to do meap I wou ld prefer them to ask question and words that we know. Another thing I dont like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion they grade of what they think of it. To mi the meap is stupid @CAPS2 I had a choice I would chose not to do it. Since the meap is important I do it for my grade. These are the reason why I am very inpatient with the meap.",13

18456,"Patients is about many things. First, there is diffrent ways to express patients. Second, people either have patients or they don’t. I admit I am one of those people that don’t have patients. My mom is always saying, “@CAPS1 your horses.” @CAPS2 I know. I don’t have patients so why does she have to tell me I don’t? I don’t have any patients in grocery shopping I can’t wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can’t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don’t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it.",11

17926,"Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patients for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at disneyland. First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I wa s. I didnt complain at all. When we got to disneyland the firs day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up t @NUM1 hours long! Well i didnt complain,but it was hard not to!My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for , but i held my patients not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting i felt like i was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second patients is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience. So,thats @NUM2 time I had to have a lot of patients, but i realized patients is a good thing to have.",21

17838,"I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.",17

We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them.

It was my first time getting shots, and I didn’t know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldn’t take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn’t take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didn’t let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said “@CAPS1,” and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots.

18096,I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I’ve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine o’clock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn’t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.,16

17981,"Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life it’s not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren’t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2.",11

18627,One time when I was patient is when I was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a top to visit my cousins in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was just a little kid so I was very excited to take my first plane ride. When we finally got to @LOCATION1 I was so excited. I asked my mom when we got to the hotel can I go swimming. She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be then I could’t wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something.,17

It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I did’t eat nothing. There was me my mom and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tries to. Some people have patient and other don’t. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients.,12

All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again.",20

With all this patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in his waiting room. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept on interrupting her and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone so she ran up the stair and she said your stupid punk so I said I don’t care.,12

We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again!",21

18567,"Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad.",24

I just don’t try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is I’m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I won’t save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it don’t want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words.",16

I didn’t want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. @CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” I asked. “Were done with the house @CAPS1 the car has yet to be washed” she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said.

I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, “Are you done?” I asked rudely. “You could help if you want it to faster” @CAPS3 answers. “@CAPS4, fine I’ll help”, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, “lets do!” @CAPS5 the whole day I waitd @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish @CAPS1 in the end I finished the job.",24

It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry.

19266,"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!",24

So, we talked some more and practiced some skills for floor. We dida head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by.

An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient.

We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong.",17

An I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. Second- we finally got our seats an I had to sit by this scary person he was weird so the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars. The jets went over us and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1).

18399,"“@CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!” I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the “maverick” at @CAPS2 point. “That’s what the sign say’s, but it could take longer,” my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone “I gusse we can wait,” but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zipo, none no patience! Why did I say yeah. Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didn’t work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didn’t want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up. We were finally at the front, and I didn’t complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I was really worth it I thought. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain. That was a time I was patient",22

Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, @CAPS1!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of @DATE1, and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to @LOCATION1. I was ??? to  get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally” That was the story of how I Was patient.",20

I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. “@CAPS3 hello there, @CAPS4” @CAPS5 grandpa said. “@CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open @CAPS5 presents?” “yah, sure.” @CAPS7 we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn’t wait. As I waited patiently until all of @CAPS5 old relatives opened their presents it was finally @CAPS5 turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was @CAPS5 turn.",15

That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage!

19439,"A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.  You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient.",12

We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t.

19459,"Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don’t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!",21

Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasn’t coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a bird’s eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.",21

So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait.",20

18297,"Do you ever fell like your @CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at @TIME1pm my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @PERSON2, and my friend @LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said ""I didnt want you to walk to get @LOCATION2 by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already @NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store @LOCATION1 questioned me and asked ""@CAPS2 did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as @PERSON2 pushed the @PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my @CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again.",21

You’re annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. “patient is everything,” one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didn’t blame him, wich all those choices, he didn’t know what to pick, the lost of the line wasn’t as patient, “harry up.” One said “come on.” @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasn’t really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed",20

After the ride I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my @CAPS2.  She had just gotten her @CAPS2 touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 too. Well I said yes. Even though I know I can’t spend a day without using or just looking at my @CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the composer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever.",18

My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2’d been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. “@CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour.” @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement “I’m sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.” @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard “@CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.” @CAPS6 a big “ughhh” swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5.",24

So when my @ORGANIZATION2 broke I took mr.groth up on his need for a @CAPS3 in @CAPS4 band. I studied my butt of learning the art of the bass @ORGANIZATION1, reading the clef and learning the notes, I was waiting for my ranking to increase and memorization and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better and it seemed each week I got better and better. I had easily fell in love with the sounds it made and I had found  I  loved it way more than the @ORGANIZATION2, shure it will take time to become a pro but I u learned its worth it .",20

19311,"“@CAPS1, how much longer.” I complained at the airport, “@CAPS2 have been waiting for about two hours now.” “@CAPS3 will only be a couple more minutes sweety.” replied my @CAPS1 in a stern voice. “@CAPS3 better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to @CAPS5 world.” I complained again. As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I haven’@CAPS8 said anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didn’@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad don’@CAPS8 like to fly to places any more.",23

During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom.

Being that there is one computer in the house I have to wait. After hours I checked to see if my brother was close to being done. He was not, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a slow typer. He finished the next day. In had no problem with it because I had lots of time to type my paper.

But of course, I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. It’s just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @DATE1 I told him I didn’t do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldn’t be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldn’t force them to or anything but I’m not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if I’m “patient,” I’m sure I will be able to do it!",16

So we waited a longer and longer till my brother started to flip out yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, “I can’t wait here any longer” @CAPS2 he went under the ?? and ?? off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finnaly, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here so l decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride.

19307,"Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to resturaunts when we wait for our food I get board very easially. On time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot.@CAPS1 my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said “I don’t think there is anything wrong, but we won’t be sure.” @CAPS1 she sent my mom and me to the urgent case out on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty five minutes car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in we waiting in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while.

We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when you’re late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1.",13

18941,"I’m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)",19

19304,"This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me.",10

After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun.

18853,"Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it’s a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn’t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad’s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, “will you use it?”",23

They drove down to the lake, got into their small rowboat and were off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch small mouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. The sun was up but it was still a little cold. The sat there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. this time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sand wiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight ''. Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner @PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish.",24

I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner.,20

I didn`t want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there. I texted people. People called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test she came out the room. I asked her “@CAPS5 did it go?” she looked at me smiled and said “I felt confident, but know @CAPS1 hungry I shouted out “me to” we got in the car and went to subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cooking, chips, and a drink it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall I told my friends what happened.

I love @CAPS1 but once a year or so @CAPS2 patient enough to wait until @DATE1 downward. The first @DATE2 of @DATE1 told me @CAPS1 was coming along with all we decorating ,carolling  and wistfull of @CAPS1 joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snow ball wars with my cousins. I still feel temptation trying to rush time and make me anxious and grueling to wait so long but @CAPS2 still patient and try to let the temptation go away. When @CAPS1 eve came I feel greatful I made it this long with patients because @CAPS2 just like my parents and cant wait for anything that takes month. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leave quicker, then I could think how fast it left. Just like the saying time file sometime  having fan.",16

19146,"“@CAPS1!!” I had another math home work assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math home work that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home sit down at the table and take my time, and doing work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us as easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a wile and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm,” @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day I remember to be patient. I also remember what we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out.",24

18960,"Book @CAPS1 ‘And the characters lived happily ever after……..for now!’ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages we’re left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results we’re very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. “@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting” said @CAPS7 “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “@CAPS9” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you” said @LOCATION1.

18285,"Patience is a very important value. To sacced you need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self- centered ,and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didn’t recognize the surroundings. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life",16

My @CAPS1’s stayed at the motorhome while my @CAPS1, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller coasters, my @CAPS1 by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my @CAPS1 were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just on??? before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have @CAPS2, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still, I had to try very hard but eventraully I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing.",19

18045,"Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  “@CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ??????  And I do not want to be late for school again”. I hollered at my @CAPS4 “@CAPS1”, @CAPS4 said in a hustled voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesn’t take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient.” “I know, I know, I sighed but I still don’t want to be late” “I know but remember, being patient will get you far.” “@CAPS6” I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didn’t whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didn’t cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didn’t grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldn’t be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on.",19

17861,One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.,16

He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient.",18

18250,"It all started on a cold and snowy @DATE1, there was only two days till @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbows. Also people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year I was going to be patient. @CAPS4 I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy new light @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. @CAPS4 when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line. My mom told me too be patient, @CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up @LOCATION1 which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient. Finally it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said as patient can. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up we were ready for @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it payed off.",23

19035,One time when I was patient was my birthday I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that’s all I wanted. All of my friends had them I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn’t know where I was. It is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was  on a @DATE1 so the night before I was at the football game everybody was asking if I was going to get me and I kept on telling  them yes I’m getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift that I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and I started to get all of my friends numbers. I learned when your patient and not asking you will get what you want.,16

19530,"I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think it’s time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didn’t say it was the time to get a phone the next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better. I still didn’t get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said “@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something” I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said “wait @CAPS2” me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said “@CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out.",24

Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if @CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until @CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" @CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered.

It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. To bad I couldn’t play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..” @CAPS1” ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. “ @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing “he added. “@CAPS4’t get to happy , there’s still plenty of time left.” I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ‘d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, “who is the loser now, huh?” wow all it took was patient, and hope” I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate what’s happening around you, you’ll end up getting rewarded!.",19

19331,A day of dreadful patience “can we leave now @CAPS1. I’m so bored I complained.” I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. “That’s it I’m gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don’t touch anything.” @CAPS1 said. So I sat here cold bored and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finaly my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. That’s when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all heard was holler’s and screams. FINALY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don’t have is patience.,20

18379,I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.,11

19207,"During the @DATE1 between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1! @CAPS4 of the rides had lines, but none of them had line as long and the @CAPS2  @CAPS3. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS5 thought @CAPS5 would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but @CAPS5 didn’t see the point. When @CAPS5 got about half way, one of the employees shouted, “@NUM1 more minutes!” and @CAPS5 @CAPS4 became more excited. Eventually, @CAPS5 made to the front of the line! @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had to do was wait for the current trial was over! But then, the speaker came on, “@CAPS4 rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and @CAPS5 must because of safety issues.” @CAPS5 had @CAPS4 considered leaving, but had a feeling @CAPS5 shouldn’t. @CAPS5 talked with some other kids @CAPS5 met in line. @CAPS5 played games like rocks, paper, scissors while @CAPS5 waited under the pavillion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thankyou from my dad  for keeping us in line.",22

Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren’t to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and I passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I’m not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me. I hope I’ll never have to do that again.",16

17857,One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the ‘A’ team and the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Finally there was about @NUM1 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was @CAPS2!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Although it wasn’t the ‘A’ team I was still happy I didn’t get out. That was a day I had to be very patient.,18

18220,"One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didn’t happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldn’t stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didn’t panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didn’t take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldn’t stop in time. When I hit my head it didn’t hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didn’t hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over.",21

So when it was time to catch some  @CAPS1’@CAPS2 my bus driver would wake us up us and we would have to get off the bus to another bus. It seemed  like  never on that bus.

18825,"Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was every patient one day when I was ten year old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy.",21

When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didn’t bother me at all. That’s how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But… I couldn’t  or we couldn’t go on it that night because it was to late. I that’s my story about  patientce  The @CAPS1,21

He told me to wait a second, but I wasn’t waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldn’t wait any longer she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand.

18708,"A time when had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 it’s about @NUM1 hrs away. So I had to sit in a car for @NUM1 hours. The only things to do were listen to your ipod and sleep. Which I didn’t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like @NUM4 if you weren’t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping. I knew I couldn’t do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2. This was a time when I had patience",18

It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. “honey get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,” my mom shouted out the window. “@CAPS1 mom,” I questioned.”it’s a suprice”she answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. “@CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come,” I asked my mom. “@CAPS6, sounds like fun she replied.” When @CAPS9 got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “@CAPS7, I don’t want to wait mom, its too long of a line,” I complained. “@CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9’ll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time,” she replied. One hour later……… “mom its taking forever.” I whimpered. “@CAPS9 are the next ones in line,” she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldn’t believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. “@CAPS6 I was, and @CAPS3 proud of that,” I said to myself.",24

17862,Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn. Thats all I know about patients.,9

19395,"Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn’t  something they teach you in my school. There isn’t a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really don’t understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so ‘tick,tock,tick,tock’. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, there’s come action. The subject (the person I’m assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I’m just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. “@CAPS2!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says “@CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient.",24
19525,"I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady havent called my name yet, after waiting like @NUM1 minutes. I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine.  Before I knew it @CAPS2 called my name, “@CAPS1” @CAPS2 said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself “maybe being patient isn’t that bad after all!”",17

She kept moving in the line @CAPS4 she didn’t even realize @CAPS11. @PERSON1 waited for @NUM5 hours that day @CAPS4 she only thought @CAPS11 was @NUM4 because she was preoccupied. @PERSON1 felt great when she finally got her licence, she was the second one in school in got her licence (after @PERSON2).“@CAPS9 @PERSON2, you taught me how to be patient and calm down.”“@CAPS10 problem, @CAPS11’s the least I could do for my best friend.”",20

When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line. I stood there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I justed waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didn’t complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch.

Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm.",15

So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn’t. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1.

Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at kings' island @NUM1 hours just to go on illegible. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us was nicor because me line shortned some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride.",24

18419,"A beaker bubbled in @LOCATION1 lab. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. “@CAPS1 what’s going on!” I yelped across the room “@CAPS2 found the cure for the cancer!” @CAPS3 said as @CAPS3 had a little jublee dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I am a doctor and I wasn’t so sure but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. “@CAPS4’s go try it out!” @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoomed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equiptment. After @NUM1 minutes I was pondering where @CAPS3 could be. @CAPS3’s just having a hard time packing up I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping @NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. “I saved this kitten’s life with my cure for cancer.” @CAPS3 said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that @CAPS3 saved the kitten, my pager dinged. @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @CAPS3 got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment I wasn’t sure if she would live. “@CAPS6 give it to her?” the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. “@CAPS7, not yet.” I waited five minutes and then poured it in. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though @PERSON1 couldn’t talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, “@CAPS8 you”. I only smiled back.",23

I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned.",24

18553,"Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you don’t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday.",11

So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie.

My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn’t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn’t get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don’t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them.",23

I what I did. My body ??? aching from walking around all day, but that wasen’t going to stop me from all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed and I began to get thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister want to go get a drink with me while my mum held our s??t in line. We made it to the booth. “I’ll take water” I said, ??? realived. I said thankyou, as I grabbed the ice cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, “@CAPS2. I couldn’t help but ask, “@CAPS3 can I please get this shirt?” we still have to wait a little bit longer in the if we go back. “@CAPS4 he responded but let’s hurry up @CAPS1 your mom dosen’t get impatient. After I got the shirt we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. All aboard the mummy ride.” The person controlling the ride explained. We walked on, being patient payed off, because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast.",23

19068,"Lots of people are good at being patient I’m not so good at it. But when your traveling along distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2’s house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we don’t mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. I’ve had to have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drank lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldn’t fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, “The up @CAPS7 store” where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to @LOCATION2’s. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to @LOCATION2’s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, I’m almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient, is not one of my favorite things to do.",24

My dad in @LOCATION1 said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandmas house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in one week. They were not at my house. I ididnt want to buy my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After @NUM2 more week I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn’t come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was estatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day knowing my patience payed off.",18

After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines.

I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the corners, the ?? the @CAPS5 ??. However when we reached the peak of the @NUM3 mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my @CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the edges. Second, my @CAPS3 started grasping my arm like her life her depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started getting up! All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself.""I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop. As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my @CAPS3's grasp on my arm was relieved and we were pulling into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in all asylum. I will always remember that ride through the mountains.",24

I tried my best to clear my head and be paitient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for celar paint’s @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimates at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us. “@CAPS1 is this taking so long?!” I said impatiently. “@CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?” “@CAPS3.”  I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of being patient. We looked at the ride and hopped on. Patience really pays off. I learned to be patient with all sorts of things.",22

Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride.

Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1, that’s a different story. I’ll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn’t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn’t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn’t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if I’m very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait.",23

18266,"One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie.",21

17932,"@PERSON1, this is boring! I want to try my backflip! I whined. @CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,"" said @PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. ""@CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my back flip.""  ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!""  ""@CAPS4?€?"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics, @CAPS6 then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do.""",24

He had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgey on his legs well after he had all the patience he had to go through surgey. He had enough patience to go through surgey.

18773,"Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. @CAPS1’s a good one to have too, @CAPS1 can help you in a lot of situations. If gas have patience, you wont get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @PERSON1 was getting me. I didn’t think about @CAPS1 that much so @CAPS1 didn’t really get to me. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep @CAPS1 off my mind. I had to make sure I didn’t think about @CAPS1, so I wouldn’t beg my friend to know what @CAPS1 was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and got on there nerves. @CAPS1’s good to be patient with friendhips, so you dont become mean to them or anyone else. @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 not good to be impatient with your family. If your patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused.",14

I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decide to be patient and read. Before I knew it we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.,22

We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch.

Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didn’t care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days I’m being patient I really can’t believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when I’m getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so I’m really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days I’ve been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I don’t have to be patient no more, the end",16

19412,Patience is when your understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasn’t even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters’ face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.,20

18839,"“@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon don’t worry,” @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called “@CAPS3” person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn’t come in the mail. I’ve been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn’t. “I’ve been sitting here since ten o’clock where is the @CAPS4 track!” I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! “@CAPS5 coming” I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 that’s it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.” @CAPS10!” I sob in agony, “ why does this feeling consume me like this?” I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. “ @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!” I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!",22

18638,To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didn’t eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new @LOCATION2 first then to @LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well that’s the day I stayed very very patient.,13

Exclaimed my @CAPS4. “@CAPS1 I can’t either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport smelling that strafoam smell, and checked in our bags. “@CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 explained to the clerk “@CAPS5 sorry according to this your @CAPS10 is full” she told us through a chessy smile. “@CAPS6 you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2.” “@CAPS5 sorry @CAPS6 it wouldnt be fair if we gave away @CAPS2 that were rightful owned.” @CAPS8 again another chessy smile “@CAPS6 you can have your orginal @CAPS2 back if you like,” @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By @NUM4 I knew the place inside out.

Beautiful restraunt soon it was time to leave. Please don’t get delayed again?! It wasn’t. I felt happy that we finally left @CAPS8 sad. I learned a great lesson about patience!

19416,When I was at universal studios and I was waiting in the long lines to get on the rides I was patient. It did take a while but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I was in a line for this dragon rollercoaster we were so close to being next then it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left so we ended up being in the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two but it never stoped. We forgot about my mom and brothers so we left. I was patient the whole time. We went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got and since it new the line was long. We waited for quit a while. We eventually got on the ride and we realized the wait was worth it so we went again.,16

19313,"“@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2!” I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. “@CAPS5 down, @PERSON1,” my @CAPS2 told me. “I’m coming”, she said. I’m not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. It’s also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and @CAPS1 up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isn’t that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. “@CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4,” he told us. “@CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?” my @CAPS2 asked me. “@CAPS10 about the @CAPS11?” I asked my @CAPS2 “@CAPS12 not?” she replied. By the way if you didn’t know my name is @PERSON1. But that’s not important right now. What’s important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the @CAPS11 isn’t the biggest ride, but it’s still pretty big. The @CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The @CAPS11 ended up being a blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. “@CAPS23 right @PERSON1, pick the last ride,” my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 that was easy. We still hadn’t gone on my favorite ride yet. “@CAPS25’s go on the @CAPS26 force,” I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @CAPS24,  I’ve been on the ride, and it’s definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldn’t be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and I’m glad I waited for the best ride.",23

17935,A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shoping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shoping it was boring but it was kind of full because some of clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq. When you have patient's it can pay off in the end and always have patiens where ever you go or are always have patients.,14

It`s almost eight “o’ clock and we have been out there since @NUM1. We hear the ducks and geese making noises in the marshland next to us, we could see the trees dance in the wind. Smell the trash dance of grass and the morning fog. Then out at nowhere at @TIME1AM then came another doe. They went by us with caution so I got the gun ready. Then out came the eight point bunch I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him. The year at @DATE2 in the youth hunt I was patient and it paid off.",23

We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes.

Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were talking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting @CAPS1 beautiful. @CAPS1 I didn’t. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dad’s favorite music was on @CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. @CAPS1 I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was @CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said “Are you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.” @CAPS1 we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself “I learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.”",20

I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ½ hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that’s why I was so calm.

I thought to myelf. ‘’ok pull over here, but it’s gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.’’  ‘’I @CAPS4’t core!’’ I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM3.’’ @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again.

I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that ‘’water park closed!’’ when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said ‘’sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow.’’ @CAPS9 out it was’nt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I could’nt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1.

18342,"Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patience because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a pisered   since birth. It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I’m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She’s improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don’t yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience.  So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will @CAPS1.",16

18127,"When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me.",18

Wrong! @CAPS6 was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! “@CAPS8 walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.” @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS4 fine.” I replied. @CAPS8 as I was halfway around the ring, @PERSON3 stopped. Then @CAPS6 turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. “@PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing!” @PERSON1 yelled “I think @CAPS6 is licking the water off the windows.” I said “@CAPS10 get him away from there, @CAPS6 could get sick!” @CAPS4, as I said earlier, @CAPS3 horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! “@CAPS8 be patient @PERSON2.” I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I @CAPS8 needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse @CAPS13 again.",21

18569,"A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didn’t understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didn’t go with science, and he didn’t listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldn’t beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient.",22

At one time I thought I was the most patient person In my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to cedar point. You have to be burn with patient. Some of my friends are patient but they can’t wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient. You have to be born with patient. Its not something you learn over the years. I could want three week without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older there grow lesser. That doesn’t work on everybody.

18312,"Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didn’t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years.",21

18068,"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.",24

Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. “@CAPS11 @CAPS12” the @CAPS12 has arrived the @CAPS12 I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12 and when my birthday was here can guess what…? I finally got the best of all.

18098,"That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole @NUM2 hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little.”",22
19385,"One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient",14

18521,Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I would’ve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right. I’m very glad I have a good amount of patience.,20

18517,"As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I’m older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I don’t care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don’t want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don’t say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help.",14

He said ""would you like something to eat?""I said ""yes""….we went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 having to wait, but I didn't care it care it was worth it.",17

It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2.,18

18284,"Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life.",11

18209,I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.,16

Then waited another day @NUM3. He wasted @NUM4 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade drope to a @CAPS2+ and now he’s blaming @CAPS3! So I told him hard @NUM5sucsess. He tried harder @CAPS4- he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is @NUM6, he’s a lot happier now that hes patient using time wisely while keeping himself occupied.",19

18857,"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better.",24

So @CAPS5 drove past @ORGANIZATION1 and then @CAPS6 started to cry. @CAPS6 had enough. “I want @CAPS4 cream!!.” @CAPS5 were messing with her, so @CAPS5 went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and got her the thing @CAPS6 wanted most her  “@CAPS4 cream.” @CAPS6 was patient the entire day, @CAPS6 knew it was hard work. @CAPS3 little sister learned an important lesson that day, that “Being patient means good things will come to you.",22

I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that we’ll be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk.

We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck.

18713,"I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it.",12

18647,"When most people think of patience they think of waiting. But that’s only half of it. Patience is waiting with out complaining, like when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five hour drive. I know that doesn’t seem like a lot but I @CAPS1 corridor. I just @CAPS1 them pure and simple. But me and my brother didn’t complain, mainly because the knight before our mom said two complained well sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isnt that scary,” so we finally go there .The week was fun, we ate good food played sweet games and wen’t to an awsome  museum. But on the ride back it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident.",18

I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a firty dollar target, forty dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff. I practiced all day long. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards. I haven’t had anything close enough to shoot since then.",17

She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""@CAPS2 can't I fly yet"" and momma said,"" @CAPS1 be patient.""",23

18652,"I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you don’t want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specaly at cedar point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. Butt @DATE1 I was going to cedar point and I coun’t wait. So I got up took a shower and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry mudines.  I got all of my close pack a week early because, I was so edsited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, sister, mom, dads so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasn’t so grate because, it was three hours long but we had a tv in our carso it didn’t take as long as it normally does because, were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the howtell it was awesome because, it was like @NUM1 storys high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room ont @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wainted to buy the furry things but she couldn’t. My mom woke us up come on the rides open in about @NUM3 min we got be there. So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. So found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed. So by the time we were all up dressed and showered the rides have been going on for an hour so we walk over to the gate and got the one ride called million ofcare. The sigh said @NUM4 hours wait sorry the ride is know just to got started because of difficutys  with the seatbelts and others technical difuctlelys sorry. So my mom said wait here at ride it is realy fun. So was waited and waited I have no patience any more I will buy you a hot dog after this so I did and the ride was a blast @NUM1 hours at the park. Was fun but we had to go tomorow. And I got my hot dog.  That was my story of being patience at cedar point when all is you want to do was have fun.

19089,"Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient, and needs to calm down. Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for litter children/ kids. You are setting an example and being considerate. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate.",12

I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive it, but I had patience. Others did not have Patience they kept asking what we are going to get @CAPS1 both were complaining they did not have Patience. Another example is we’re going to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 and we still had planned the day I did not have ruler here that time, and it made it worse leaving the patience the more thinking about it and that made it work .Men @CAPS1 sometimes more  on and patient and sometimes not so much",15

18584,"Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better.",21

18581,"Being patient means that when your in a bad situation you don’t complain. Some people aren’t vary patient and some are very patient. In my eyes patience is very important, I likes to think of myself of sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privillage to go when you want get taken away then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself be patient we’ll stop at the next place. Another thing was you were alway hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times that was not fun. Also whenever you got food was not enough. But I did’nt complain. Lastly you just really want to get there you couldn’t wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience. When we finally got there I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience and I pasted, and actually it wasn’t nearly as bad as the trip back.",19

There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else.",17

If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasn’t the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school he frield out for the varsity, but didn’t make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he should’ve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didn’t quit or tell himself that he wasn’t good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3’s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star.",20

I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs.

19072,"“@CAPS1” I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldn’t land it. My gymnastics’ coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he see’s me he says “my baby!” and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn’t. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. “@CAPS1” I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again”, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn’t stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.",22

There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful.

Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn’t too bad. that was one of the few times I’ve been  patient, and don’t know if it counts since I was with somebody.",16

I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While @CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. “@CAPS2 here I’m done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please,’’ I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. “@CAPS1 done !” I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today @CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. “@CAPS6!” I yell waiting  for my dog to @CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesn’t listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off.",22

19463,"A time when I was being very patient was when I went to “@CAPS1” at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called “The dead zone”, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say “were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called “The mauerie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I don’t think so.",21

You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really little mabey four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldn’t go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antcy. After a while I started asking “When is the ride going to be over mama” she kept responding “I don’t know, when ever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride.” @CAPS2 I couldn’t wait, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said “ok” and thats when I got sad then she said to me “but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy.” “I love smoothys” I scream. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience ia a hard thing to do but once you got it, it’s a good thing to do.",20

I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. “@CAPS1’s gonna be a long ride” I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn’t nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.,19

19112,"Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you don’t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that’s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences.",11

19386,I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!,22

I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying. It was @NUM2 am. I turned on the @CAPS5, threw in a movie, and waited. At @NUM3 am most of my brothers were up and I couldn’t take it anymore. I snapped and started to complain. I had become very impatient. I finally was told yes and began to open my presents.

She wanted tickets to his concert, but when the sold out online she didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1’s face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result.

It’s my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one… I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I don’t want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. “hey mom when are we having the family party?” “@DATE2.” @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isn’t patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now I’ll be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldn’t have made it. Im not very patient.",24

18580,"My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top l will @CAPS1 at (cedar point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simpily silent cvery unasul) and just waiting .I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I was about to die of boredom .My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn’t stanistrn. She was just standing there not talking. When we started to move I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient",22

18249,"When I think of being  patient I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for hockey, we were on the road for @NUM1 ½ hours! While  we were on the way there i didn’t say one thing about how much longer or anything, although I was on a claster bus with all my hockey friends wathing a hockey movie. When I think of patients I think of wating without asking  “@CAPS1 it done yet?’’ or “Are we there yet?” I myself dont have the best patients. when I want the computer or to role the guard or frarwheeler and someone was on those things I tend to ask “when will he be dane!” alot. Patients grows with you when you develop, as you get older you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long even this test takes patients!",13

18907,"@PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He slowly walked, staggering on the ice, out to the barn. The barn was unlike any other. It was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. @PERSON3 said, @CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked."" ""@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!"" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said ""@CAPS3!"" ""@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise,"" @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls."" You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @DATE2."" @CAPS5 is @DATE1. Right?""I asked ""@CAPS6 day!"" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I love @PERSON3. Not just because he is my dad. Also he is a great man. Happy, funny sweet and patient @PERSON3.""",23

18559,One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days!,19

19087,"A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldn’t just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world.",19

18762,Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn’t know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents weren’t coming until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. My dad had a appogized and went to get me after I explained then I could finally go home.,17

Like most kids, I dont wine and fuss about waiting. In my head I’m thinking when I whould get to go on the ride. I dont scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The second go on. tic tac tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later it was finnaly my turn to go on the rollercoaster I was so exited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! that line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Well on well. That line was worth it.",20

I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasn’t going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music.” mom that our favorite song.” @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said “you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here.” @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. “lets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said, “ @NUM2 hours later”.

You have yourself a deal.” @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next.” The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. “@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I want”. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off.

18454,"Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist’s office. This @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl’s tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didn’t it was fair that I had to wait another @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn’t mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory.",24

Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things .I let my brother and sister s play first because I’m the oldder one and I have to wait ptiencetly until it was my town. Well until it was my turn @CAPS4 wood have to take playing the game on the things, @CAPS4 wold do that until the day was done. Or until tomoro was done. That wold be it until next @DATE2 or until @CAPS4 can play it again.  And that’s what I say I do as being patience at home and the respect my brother and sisters.",15

18691,"One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself “nothing will get in my way” well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. That’s when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minuets. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn’t so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something.",22

17991,"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",24

So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe.",20

The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom danced me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little yearly. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they weren’t. After waiting thirdy minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didn’t have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When I was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, “it starts at @TIME1. So I have to leave”. She kept asking me why I didn’t call and I kept telling her I didn’t have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I can’t go an hour. Thats one of the horrible times I was patient.",17

Then @CAPS10 were next to go on the ride. When @CAPS10 entered the ride I fastened my seat. Next the ride took off! The breeze felt good against my face.

Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Let’s just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you. Here’s another example let’s just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience.",12

Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago,” @CAPS2 how much longer?” The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, “not much longer now dear.” @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but can’t help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope.” @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now.” @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. “You know it’s funny,” @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. “@CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person out there!” I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that I’m a patient person.  stand in the",24

The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team.

If you are patient, most people will probalbly like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probalbly get a “@CAPS1 you” from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park ride’s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important.",10

So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckly my best firend and I had good patients unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experences of my life. “I’m so happy we waited” said @PERSON1 my best firend.

When you go to the dentist or doctor’s office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist. She hated the dentist. It was always so boring. First, you‘d sit there while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there for like @NUM1 minutes before you even go in. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for like ten minutes, then you’d sit there for another fifteen minutes. Finally, When you are done getting your teeth cleaned you’d sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist.

18006,"When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she I had to wait until @CAPS1. That got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchsreen with a key board. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone. Also a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it it was only a week until @CAPS1 so I was excited, even though I had to pay for phone bill. I just wished the time would fly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was wait. After six day past, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating of excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom. So being patient will eventually pay off.",16

18121,"I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive.",14

Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently.,18

I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didn’t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone.

19254,"Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet.",10

Until the final seconds ended. The madichian as finally free. And alive,16

Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said “I don’t know” of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didn’t listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didn’t work because she didn’t talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said “why”. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didn’t reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back “here”. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don’t know why she didn’t talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient.",19

My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the “ @CAPS2 trap”, “@CAPS3 star”,. Also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and  I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the “@CAPS4 timbers.” The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn’t want to wait long. She said “you need patience”  I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said “mom that patience really paid off”.",16

18243,"During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didn’t know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didn’t know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didn’t say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who don’t know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes won’t go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I’m not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn’t once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didn’t yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would’ve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I’m amazed at my mom’s understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too.",24

17871,"One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain.’’ @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane’s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6’s back turned.’’ @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.’’ @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances.",24

So we just get in the line and sign, it was at least @NUM4 something degrees. we waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got into the chair and a bar came over us, I remember one thing set a quarter on  your leg and gravity takes a hold of it .

18445,"Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people can’t wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second wouldn’t be so hard because you would be calm. That is patience in my own way.",9

On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me.

18586,"Patience is a kind thing , people being patient, but still complaining about it thats not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while your doing it. People that loose their patience easily really is not cool, its nice when someone waits for you if say your on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something. Its very poliete if you have patience, I don’t know the definition of it but am just gonna guess, I think its a person waiting patiencently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere.",11

19315,"I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored.",12

18448,"In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn’t get to sleep in very much, I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn’t going with us. We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1’s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1’s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching  the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. “@CAPS1” my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight.",19

18042,"Did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness. For an example I was walking and @CAPS1 this guy walked up. To and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasn’t very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I snaped and said “do you know to shut up”! badly he said “yes” @CAPS1 ran home., crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @CAPS1 said “sorry”.! And for some reason he said “got you” I said “what” I was so mad but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don`t know who watching, literally.",16

17892,"I know I can I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards tried kicking over and feel! Errg! I stood back up and asked @PERSON1 my coach, “@CAPS1 my shoulders right?” @CAPS2 @CAPS1 your shoulder the kick over. “@CAPS3 got it” I said. As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom face could never be replaced @CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @CAPS4 ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said “thank you for being so patient.” @CAPS4 said “@CAPS5 for you baby.”",17
18819,One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.,16

Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car.

When the game finally came out on @DATE1 fourteenth two thousand ten, I bought with my friends and the game is amazing. I would give it four of five stars. I’m not absessed with it through.

18934,"Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience",17

I did try to make it rush by, but it didn’t work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying, “ can’t it come anymore,” but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didn’t. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient.",23

We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread!

19543,Will I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that farthers day morning in @DATE1 I was so exicted. I’m not a very patient person so when it came to this it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard but when she was in my arms it was the must ama-zing feeling in my life. it’s always hard having to leave her when she’s calling your name it’s like I want to cry. I don’t always get to come home to a little girl saying my name but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what I mean.,16

19248,"Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little it’s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn’t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3.",21

Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!",18

I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old.

19247,In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.,13

When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirpping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked hardly anybody was there but @CAPS2 went to a store called???, it was so full of people  I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited.  Finally @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the casher said “@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.” @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient.",18

18662,"A time that I was patient was when I took my first @CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes.",18

I had to wait for about two (@NUM3) hours before getting called into the room, but than I waited @NUM4 so they could get the shots ready. So I waited about five hours and five minutes, after all that time I finally went to eat some lunch at @ORGANIZATION1. That was all I did that day.",16

17976,"Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn’t just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience.",9

19197,"@PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girl?€™s choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. ?€œ@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.?€?I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1?€™s friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1?€™s better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now it?€™s @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself don?€™t be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasn?€™t because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1?€™s I have a note taped to it. It reads ?€œ@CAPS3 me your phone number and I?€™ll call you for the @NUM1.?€? Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think he?€™s testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didn?€™t ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.?€™ When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word. Yes!",24

Patience is when you understand things and tolerate and when you experience thing that not ??? complain that when patience is.You have to have patience if you planning on having kids or being  I cather or any other job you have to wait in ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???.Those are a just a couple reason why ??? patience.The final reason that am going to say you need patience is because in life everything  is not just ??? to you.You have to work for it and to that you have to have patience.So no matter what if you don’t have patience you will have  a really hard time getting through life.So thse are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience.So if you don’t have patience learn to be patient.I believe that you can do it all you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and don’t complain about ??? that hard in life there is going to be a lot of hard things in life.Theres only one more thing I have to say and that is just try.,10

I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field.",17

My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didn’t even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didn’t lose my patience.",18

19382,"A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn’t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”",17

18776,"A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversery dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @CAPS2’s pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parent are out, they’ll be back in a few hours, I’ll ask later. @CAPS6 finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, “I don’t know.” And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied “finally!” @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, “@CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!” @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, “@CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long. Thanks for being @CAPS6 patient!”",23

The line must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. I’m sorry. Thanks for your cooperation” click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! It’s time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!” That was my story of being patient.",24

18538,"Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have.",18

After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there.

However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners.",20

It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying “hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody.",9

18134,Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should’nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.,12

It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.,16

You guys better give me back my clothes or I swearI ll @CAPS6 off the camera!” yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 atempted to grab his clothes… and missed. “@CAPS8!

You can @CAPS5 put this on the internet!” “so your going to stop picking on us?” I asked “@CAPS8!” @CAPS4 said , “@CAPS13, then I’ll just zoom in right here.” “@CAPS13!” @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off.

19243,"Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, you’re time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman ? @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didn’t even see it, truth be told I’m not even sure if it happen but you can’t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn’t took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn’t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didn’t a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite! Nobody‘s perfect, you’ll have to wait and see who will score the next point!",24

18022,"Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didn’t. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, “@CAPS1 do you want!” @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 not be an expert @CAPS2 he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way.",18

19332,The time I had @NUM1 be patient was when I was at my first foot ball game. I wanted to get in but I had to wait. I waited an hour to get in. The team was tied in the @NUM2 to @NUM2 and it was the @DATE1 and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he put me in I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball he tumlied and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient I wouldn't have won the game cause the coach wouldn't have put me ind that was the time I was patient.,15

17930,I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn’t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn’t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That’s exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.,21

19109,"One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait @NUM1 hours till we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate, we also watched movies on @PERSON1 @CAPS1 player. We finally got their, but I had to wait some  more for registration and I had to wait  till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friend, or last read in your cabin.  When the  bell rang we all went into the program center and waited  for chapel to end. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait @NUM1 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it).",19

18560,"It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience some times. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1. First we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. After that we saw our cousins. I never even saw them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets."" @CAPS4 my dad. We bought the tickets and went in line."" @CAPS5 are there so much people?"" I asked. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. ""@CAPS6 be patient,"" my dad replied. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @NUM2 minutes we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, almost to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat. Patience can be rewarding.",23
19546,In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned of trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way is airport and there was?? trying to work through traffic but we could not. So my mom starting yelling and l told her just calm down we will make it.

19491,I was patient last year when I was when I was taking the ??? and it was not done. I hate being patient and when I do it is boring. Patients seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting head akes and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking to much. And that is why I don’t like being patient.,8

18178,"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!",22

18318,Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift.,14
18038,As I walked down the lane looking for the perfect gift I saw the day before. I find out it was sold out. Today was my mom’s birthday and I find the gift. The perfect gift a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager  if fact had any in the back sadly they didn’t. He said “The new shipment should be arriving at five”. I didn’t think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I was pacing back and forth thinking it would occupies sadly it didn’t. Finally I realized I needed to relax and be patient before. I know if the time was five and my dad and I went back at the store in no time and there was the perfect gift right there in front of me. I picked it up and give it to the clerk to scan. I hand her the money and head strait home. When mom get home I hand mom the gift and realize patient come in handy when it comes to waiting.,21

17924,"I was patient for a whole @DATE1. Although, that was only because @CAPS2 mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the wii. For @CAPS5 had just come and had me interested the first time I saw @CAPS5. @CAPS5 was comoletely doctor and had advanced graphics.  I had informed  @CAPS2 mother about this system immediately.  ""@CAPS1, I will buy @CAPS5 for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" @CAPS2 mother had guarenteed me.  ""@CAPS3! Thanc you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting @CAPS2 hopes up and expecting @CAPS5 within  @CAPS6 weeks. Although I had done that only to later on dissapoint myself. @CAPS2 mother had informed us that I was to get @CAPS5 in between the time period of one to  the months. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" I had shouted. "" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life. After appioximontly one and a half months of waiting, @CAPS2 mother had finally and, ""@CAPS9 are going to @CAPS10 today to buy your wii"""". At that very moment. I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even  me. So when @CAPS9 pulled up to @CAPS2 favorite video game retail store, I was so excited  I couldn't sit still.  ""@CAPS13 down! Geez, @CAPS5's just a video game system!"" I @CAPS12 stopped immediatly. ""That's what you @CAPS14."" I mumbled to myself. When @CAPS9 had returned home, I had kept playing until @TIME1. So that is when I learned  @CAPS5 pays off when your patient.",24

19506,"Sometimes on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, I have to control myself so I don’t just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! Like @DATE1 actually we are going camping up in @LOCATION2. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when  we do we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an “adventure hike,” so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesn’t!) And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isn’t ready yet. @CAPS4 I get to be in a bad mood… again! And have to wait some more!",20

18026,A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.,19

18065,"Being patient means waiting, when one of my brothers was patience. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother, we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared but I knew ther if I was patient everything would come out good. So we were waiting we had to bail him at before @NUM1 o’clock. We were theire since @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My mom was very nervous. I told her many time to calm down everything was going to be alright. So he and my cousin went in we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren’t bailing out at that time that maybe around @NUM3. So we went to get something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was @NUM4 o clock. They gave us something we had to cook. We went to @NUM1 different stores and they said we couldn’t cash it. So we went to the chase bank and we cashed it and we took out my brother.",14

19454,My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something. You have to wait until they done. An if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude.,10
18115,Patience is a special skill for some people and some its very hard. When I was a little girl I was never had any patience and even now. I do not have any either but my friend was always patient for me yah she would tell me to hurry up or lll leave but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and jekc it to the pound that’s what she would always do to. Patience I will probebly never lean till @CAPS1 like older but I know I will learn it someday. One time my friend waited for @NUM1 hours just to learn about history I would have never learned that my but then again she did get ??? ???? on her @CAPS2 homework. so her patience for that was like really cool and she told me that patience is a number one priority. his was one time my friend had patience.,15

18959,"A time when I was pacient is when I’m at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill pacients is the key. For example when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to hand stand it was difficult. Day after, day I never could do it. I put my personl best ever day but I had to be pacient my coach said. He said when the day comes you’ll do it but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me “I told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill. I learned being pacient is hard and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you.",21

18489,"My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and I’m not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didn’t break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a @CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor.

Then, I’ll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I’ll also wait until @DATE1 again.

School can be really fun sometimes, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesn’t take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she’ll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be @CAPS1 nothing. That really wouldn’t be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble.",14

That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bath rooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honered and also happy. That night was the best for @PERSON2",17

18271,"When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw at cedar point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the @CAPS1.  The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things.",20

19239,"Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three step to being patient, being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient. Being patient",19

18835,"One day, last year I had to be really patient my mom had told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldn’t wait so I asked her when and she said she didn’t know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week I was just happy that school was finally out so I didn’t have to worry about home-work. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldn’t randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didn’t have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because that’s better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been.",22

I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself ‘what good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.’ @CAPS3 these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. ‘I almost lost my patient’ @CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I wasn’t it would’ve ruined my fathers trip.

I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about @NUM1 min.” @CAPS1 I said ok. @CAPS1 we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no I’ll wait in the car. @CAPS1 I was inside of the car waiting and I got boare  and turned  the music on and this was ??? about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work @CAPS1 I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight.

Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down.",16

Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd  came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the  hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one.

18656,"Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go throught it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldn’t wait to get to @LOCATION1. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait @NUM1  hours until the plane left and we’d be on our way to @LOCATION1. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers “I’m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up.” @CAPS1!? “@CAPS2 long will it take?” asked my mom.” About five hours, “she said. It’s a good thing we brought our @CAPS3 player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @CAPS2 hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family.",24

When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience.

My two sister and I boreded @CAPS1 to florda. It seemed like we were sitting on the @CAPS1 for hours befor it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all at the people just sitting there some were on laptops and listening to @CAPS2 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then.",16

After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster then ?? I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fis of the day and learning something new.",22

18676,I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didn’t even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to???.  I ask him what I wanted and he said “you’ll shoot you eye out side.” @CAPS2 when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time I’m going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.,24

18720,Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don’t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patients I wouldn’t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don’t have and they get bad grades and everything.,10

18964,"A long wait   @CAPS1 ‘only four’ at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn’t care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea but I didn’t love it either. Of course. It didn’t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I don’t get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I’ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can’t wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !",23

18571,"Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient.",13

17965,"In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you don’t be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didn’t get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life.",12

18756,"Who likes being patient it’s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",21

I’ve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didn’t stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. “@CAPS1” I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied “@CAPS2 can’t afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. “@CAPS3” thank you “mom” I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the??

18804,Being patience is a good thing because if you are and then you are in some rough time in life. Patience people can do by bringing something to do. They could what there for three hours and not be herd. There are some people that can’t what there for three hours. There are some people that can’t what there for ten minets. These people get made at that and they will just give up. But after all of those people that can and can’t people cant quit. People what there for one hour and will blow up. And then there are people that can’t do it but they do. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can’t do it.,9

When we get there, there’re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn’t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said “@CAPS8, I know you’ll catch on soon!” and I wondered out loud “@CAPS9?,’ @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper “because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.”",22

After you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you. I have to admit, I don’t have a lot of patience, but hunting requires a different kind of patience.

This is one thing that I definetly think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of it’s an entertaining patience. That is why I think everyone should be more patient.",14

18444,One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store but my mom had to do other things before we went to the store so I had to be patient. My mom had to go to where she works because she forgot something. Then she had to go to the gas station. Then we finally went to the store and I got the toy that I wanted.,12

18748,"Patience, having patience means you don’t complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding. Some reasons why you should @CAPS7 patience are things like .  You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 wait in a extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, “ @CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5.” Or, “ @CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave.” @CAPS3’t @CAPS6 just @CAPS9?” Your @CAPS1 would be thinking, “ @CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking?” Or she would just want @CAPS8 scream. So your @CAPS1 probably wouldn’t ever want @CAPS8 take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldn’t want @CAPS8 be patient or you would wan’t @CAPS8 be inpatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would @CAPS7 a bad first impression.So your @CAPS1 is taking @CAPS5 talking on the phone so you keep saying,’’@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9,@CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!” @CAPS10 you wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind , gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, your picturing yourself screaming at someone who you’re waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try, it sometimes just don’t let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside.",16

18972,"In my life there has been many times were I have been patient and times when have hot been patient. For example the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to target I could got gum. My mom said you but I had to with a little bill. I was patient by waiting for my mom to take me. When I got to target my mom told  me to ???  up. I ran into  the ???  in the  pay ???  so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad I was patient. Also instead of my mom getting mom she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is, about. Week ago when I asked my dad do play ??? with  me. He said  you but  you have to wait a whiler. I got very mad for some reason and lost my patience. I started yelling why I have to wait. I then reach  I was having rate and that I lost any patience. I said sorry and then we played  catch.",17

18490,A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at cedar point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music but that didn’t really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever.,14

17938,"Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not.",9

17859,"Im writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again.",17

18164,Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesn’t want to be at home because he mom don’t let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.,19

18879,"You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “@CAPS2, don’t do it again.” @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have.",17

18308,"Some people a completely patient. Some people aren’t patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we’re going somewhere special, or I’m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It’s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can’t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I’m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I’m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn’t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don’t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers aren’t always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!",12

Then   my cousin  had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was @CAPS1 about to get ????????????????? called at and said “let’s go.” I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van.  In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience.",19

If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.",12

Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too.

19097,My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don’t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don’t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don’t get the secrety on you.,8

19008,Patience is when you wait for something with out complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient si icould go into a ride in @LOCATION1 adventures. It was shimbering timbers. The line was very and when I mean very I mean long. It took me about a half of hour to get on ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one was shorter. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these  rides have to show patiene because if I didn’t show patience I wouldn’t be riding the good rides. The last one is when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the thunder hawk and the line took like for a whole hour. I played my nintendo as while I was waiting so it could be patient. An hour later I got to ride that ride all because of patience.,12

I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day.",22

18590,"I had to be patience many times. I had to be patience when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patience. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room.  It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert.  I was so nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patience, but I waited and got good results.",15

18558,"For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunter’s orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in it’s place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience @MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.",23

19283,Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come.,18

19502,"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you’d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still live. Playing the piece isn’t so bad, it’s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don’t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says I’m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I’m not really looking forward to this year’s @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I’m not going to get any homework. But if I do, I’ll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I’ll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly.",24

After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didn’t get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,” @CAPS8 don’t cut me.” @CAPS11 that didn’t’ really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person.

17908,"One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you  are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didn’t blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldn’t have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you.",24

18973,Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.,12

18231,"A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient.",23

There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away.

18424,"“@CAPS1 on hurry up,” my friend said. “I know, be patient,” I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Being patient is all ways a good thing have you ever heard something like “Patience is a virtue? Well if you don’t get used to it.",17

18215,Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then they’ll be able to sit and wait or there’s a really long wait or line. Or they’ll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That’s what patients mean to me in my own way.,8

A way is being understanding to your teacher because they’re there to help you to teach you for life. If you don’t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you don’t have patience with you parents and don’t listen to them then you won’t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life.",10

I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying.

We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seat to sit in.  After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my mom’s hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient.",18

18741,"Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can’t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn’t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it’s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around.",24

I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty.

He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will contune explain to me until I understand what @CAPS1 means. Some people @MONTH1 be impatient because of triats or because that he or she has high blood pressure. Patience is something my people have, but @CAPS1 seems like even move people lacks @CAPS1.",10

I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted.

19034,"Fishing is a great sports, but it takes a lot patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about @NUM1 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn’t easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient accomplishing what I did took every oune of patience I had. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1 he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a differently. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that  I should bring a friend. So if I get boared, I would someone to talk to.The patience started when we were about half way there and @CAPS1 ! We hit a fence. The car had broken down so we called a land break.The wait was about @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 min and my friend asked. So are and my friend sucked .We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way .Once we got there, we had two problem to fix, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to sea venge for some baits, which took about @NUM4 hours for enough baits.We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited.There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend ,and I caught @NUM5 fish ! We had eat three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened but we went fishing , relaxed, and brough a couple of meals. Thats why I have fishing because it requires patience.",20

18641,"I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while.",17

The line was super long, it was like going  through a maze because how the rope were tied up we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours . But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how . When we sat down in the rollar coaster it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for.",16

18442,I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasn’t feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said “@CAPS1 it’s already been ten minutes” “I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor.” I said. “I don’.t know but lets wait a bit longer. Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I wandered. Was my doctor even here today? I starred at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. “@CAPS1 it’s almost @NUM1!” “@CAPS2!” I said flustered and annoyed. “Are we just gonna sit here all day?” I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. “@CAPS3 for being patient! the nurse said smilling. I smiled back. I @CAPS4 been patient.,23

I wish I could’ve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. A the end of the day I beged to go on one more ride.

It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said “ready”, I said ready for what another line he said “no” to look at your “room and relax .“ I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient.",16

19216,"Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I don’t really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too!",14

19557,"Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. ""@CAPS7 anyone even out here?"" I whispered ""@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!"" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He   was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot.

Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient what even  your  doing  even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things, just be very patient.",11

18291,"What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient.",22

We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn’t get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said that’s ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma and that we were going to spend the night in a hotel I so we would be even closer to @CAPS1 adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our??? ??? and @NUM2 extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to @CAPS1 adventure that next morning.

18752,This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I desided to tell my self I didn’t want it so I wasn’t anxious to get it. That kind of worked. But when I got it to tell you the truth it isn’t as fun as I thought it would be.,14

17986,"Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid of. It was @DATE1, exactly two mounts before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was to young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, this was partly true. She told me she would about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday supprise. I opened my pressants from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opend it, it was my phone. I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. Thats why you should always be patient, and wait. By; @PERSON1.",17

17881,Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1 we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.,12

My dresser and grabbed my @MONEY2 @MONEY3 that I was saving up to buy something just incase we went to the store When we got there I saw my cousin’s dad @CAPS1 walking a puppy. I walked up to him and asked about the dog, he said it was his brothers dog and he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog so I asked him how much did he coast. @CAPS1 said @MONEY1. I got really excited because I had @MONEY2 and could get @MONEY3 from my granding. So I called my mom but she was busy somewhere else but she told me that she wanted to see the dog before I buy him. So @CAPS1 waited their for hours but my mom took forever. Then finally I got impatience and bought him. But my wow wasn’t mad because she ended up liking him",21

I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that’s a time I use patients to wait for something.",16

19143,Being patient is waiting your turn in line and @CAPS3 cuting you should wait because cuting in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and  @CAPS1 disrespectful. and you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you don’t wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rouged to rush things when other people don’t want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you don’t wait. Be respectful and wait it’s a better way to make friends. And if someone is @CAPS3 being respectful to you tell them to be. And then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr.,12

19003,"This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For “bragging rigts,”we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn’t play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like it’s the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadn’t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, ”can you do it?”I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!",22

I was so excited to try this ride the family finaly moved up bup bup finally!!! We were next. We all got in our seats and made sure we were backled in nice and tight. The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long it was worth the wait. That was the time is was patient.,17

18605,Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her ??? figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of bein patient,22

I wasn’t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school.The next day i was really looking foward to getting them and I comforted her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the @DATE1 and she still didn’t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. Finally she gave the back and you will never believe that am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she’s a good friend and im a patient person.,16

Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, “@CAPS4 kind is @CAPS5? He said, “@CAPS5’s a walleye.” I didn’t know @CAPS4 to say. My first walleye!

My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. “@CAPS1 ride gave me the most fan, heartstopping, andrenalin pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After @NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disapointed to find out it’s a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figure the best way to do @CAPS1 was to keep quiet and relax.

This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all in fact he when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally @CAPS1 was our turn and my mom was very patient the worker, (even though she didn’t want to be) the worker didn’t know what was wrong with box so she gave her a new one and we left.

My parent told me to wait until we all see the rest of the art prize amazing art. So I signed and replyed ok we can see the rest of the art prize things first.  While we were looking at the art the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about. ??? A little bit later. I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at art prize. So I checied up and disieded patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while it all of a sodden it seems more valuable.  A couple hours later I started to head to the car, and my mom intrupted and said, “@CAPS1 don’t you want to see the winning piece of art?” “@CAPS2 yes I forget.”@CAPS3 there is not a line now so when we go to see it there was no line. I was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patient is important, because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like.",24

18636,"Just before @DATE2 break, in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighbor’s house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didn’t have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didn’t understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away… and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders. Inside was a note: @CAPS7 only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understood.",24

We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample.",16

The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient",24

18565,"What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are in a traffic jam in a long line, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to “hurry” or “move faster.” @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect.",13

18729,"There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn’t go on to the next part. Also we couldn’t talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldn’t talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didn’t no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year I’m alway patient. That a story on when I’m patient.",16

19499,"We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let @PERSON2 go up to clean”  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. “friend” @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1’s  text messages. I’ll admit @PERSON1 wasn’t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!",21

19380,A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the destroyer’s. So in all the game’s I always had to wait to the @DATE2. So in the @DATE1 game of the season I got in four times. In the first @DATE2 I got in for about one minute. the I got in for @NUM1 minutes in the @DATE1’s. I was happy but I still wasn’t starting. then we got into the play off’s I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamate’s came up to me and said don’t worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few month’s I waited patiently. Then we got in tournament’s then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoff’s then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient.,16

19241,"At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient.",16

18292,"Two years ago my dad had surgery on his because he broke it at work .I had to sit in a waiting  room  for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do .Every two hours my mom ,grandma ,grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch .After about four hours I got really  tired ,but didn’t fall asleep .That was the longest I’ve sat in one place my entire life .At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two .",16

18814,"What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tryed everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didn’t work. My mom says I have to be @NUM1 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and she’ll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place.",20

Since they’re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. it’s hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn’t want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is.",24

We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead” and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”!

I was dissapointed, because the shipped it from @LOCATION1 and it doesn’t take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasn’t happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom go ahed to ask when they’re going to send it and the lady said, “it’s on the way.” A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up.

I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn’t wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldn’t hush. Tthen I said, “ @NUM1 , what’s the matter ?” @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying.

19302,Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.,11

I just can’t wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but I’m not. I’m not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I don’t think that will happen anytime soon.",14

18895,"Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”",13

It took me an hour to finish it it`s a good thing I was patient. He looked down and said @CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better.

After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line.

18771,"Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to @CAPS1 point. When we went to @CAPS1 point we all were ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop ?the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out intil we got to the bumper cars.",21

17899,"“@CAPS1! Look out!” @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulences’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, hunny!” my mother teared up as @CAPS6. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.",24
18882,"That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game.",14

Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.,12

I frudged through the mud as the slick rain hammed on my skin. I should have waited. I was patient as they explained it. But I didn't listen. I should have waited. I should have waited, wait have I shoulded. The words mixed together. My bones cold, I was only about @NUM1 yards from home. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently.

Fast foot steps, the door opens. I am showered with hugG. ''You should have waited!'' my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly.",22

19538,"The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball she’ll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames.",14

My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunatly, @PERSON1 wasn’t mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, “@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?” @CAPS5 time she didn’t say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had expieriences with many patient people and @CAPS5 expierience turned out to be fun!",21

19261,"The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don’t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don’t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!",17

18678,"The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don’t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don’t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don’t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don’t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosn’t pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something that’s a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe wan’t to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients.",11

19152,"It was @DATE1, @CAPS1 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why don’t you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dad’s house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it can’t I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my mom’s house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I won’t get it. And so @CAPS6 came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough you’ll get what you want.",18

I had completed in. it was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the @DATE1, but I didn’t know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given.  They called @PERSON1’s number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disapointed, but I couldn’t do anything about it.",19

19295,"Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. It’s one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting  their turn without complaining about it . Sometimes people don’t like being patient I know I don’t lik to a lot @CAPS1. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not ??? tuned others wait. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet don’t talk very much even when they do talk they ??? talking when people inturupt them. And they defiantly don’t yell as someone  out at all. It’s a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an ??? (part not legible) good family good friends and a ??? .So in conclusion that;s why it’s good to be patient.",13

18034,"Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office.",24

19512,"My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complian. The line was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good @CAPS2 waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler and grab a orange @CAPS1. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When when he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good @CAPS2 be patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macovoni and cheese when @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS3 for safeing a seat for me."" When we both finished we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafaterra. In the gym other kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grab a basketball. I waited until the @NUM2 grated were done, I was patient, the teacher then told the younger students to go back to class, when I got the ball I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play around the world.

18248,"Patience is the key to life some say. I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things.",11

This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient.",20

I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way.",24

I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn’t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that.",20

17919,A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a @DATE1 when I was at the park. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slide. My little brother came running over their and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1. when my brother returned he asked “where do I go?” And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone I was trying to be patient when  he got back he had my mom. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like along time to me. When he called my name my mom picked me up and she went toward the doctor. He asked “what brings you here?” we told him the news and he took into the room. The doctor moved my foot around. Ten minutes later he came back in with the x-rays and annoced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crushes and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient and I said thank you!,23

19145,"Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin’s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they’re doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousin’s birthday party ? babysitting requires a lot of patience!",24

18831,"It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now.",18

17980,"This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1.There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So i packed a magazine, some  paper my @CAPS1 and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didn’t know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids!” “@CAPS3!” @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. Tthat is the story of a time I was patient",24

18151,Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. I’ve been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til’ closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.,16

19524,"Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs.",19

For example (for your convenance I @CAPS1 be wrighting a story about patience, please  take to note that this story @CAPS6 completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman, she was having trouble with her grocerys. @CAPS1 wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin @CAPS2 that @CAPS4 be arriving at his house any moment now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied “if you could I live over @CAPS3” she pointed to a large tan house. @CAPS1 carried her things to the door. “@CAPS3 you go,” he said. “@CAPS4 you mind helping me put them away” the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go into a strangers house, but @CAPS1 sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said, “@CAPS6 your home unlocked” “@CAPS7 its not” she replied, where are your keys” @CAPS1 asked, “I beleve there lost somwere in the lawn. @CAPS1 searched for about a half hour, then he found them under a bush.

When they were all put away @CAPS1 said “@CAPS11 I ought to be going.” “@CAPS11 not without somway I can repay you” said the woman “@CAPS13 go find my purse.” @CAPS1 waited and waited, it had to have been a hour. The woman came out of the kitchin with some change. “@CAPS15 its only change, I couldn’t find my wallet” she said and gave him the change. @CAPS1 left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. @CAPS1 told his mom about his good deed and his cousin @CAPS2 got to stay longer.

17888,A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!,16

19140,"Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just don’t have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didn’t know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady @PERSON1 @CAPS1 loved my speech! After we my friend, @ORGANIZATION1 and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to eachother and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, “@CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him?” then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we won’t talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasn’t patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldn’t tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that we’re both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, @CAPS3 having patience is a good thing but sometimes people can’t have patience when they want to become friends.",20

17860,Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didn’t say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didn’t go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children… I don’t like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are “guardian parents” they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.,16

18311,"This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello.",24

It was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me “ the second one is ? being to patient.”",15

I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room. Folder laundry and watched television. It was about @DATE1 and she still wasn’t home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it.",22

They turned into a @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they wouldn’t die, they would become a @CAPS1. They thought @PERSON3 was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. @PERSON2 came back after @NUM1 years searching for something to help get @PERSON3 out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don’t complain while doing it.",20

18228,"Patience is very important, it can help you be successful in many things. In school patience is very important because some things just have to wait. Being patience in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other persons makes his or her move  you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting. For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and can’t wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also on your birthday you don’t know what you’ll get but instead of peeking you have to be patient you can open the presents up. Patience is a very helpful skill to have",12

19028,"Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can’t. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new “@NUM1” flat screen @CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he could’ve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just won’t. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into  tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont",14

19139,"Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience.",11

Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. @CAPS5 up, @CAPS5 in the shower, @CAPS5 dressed, @CAPS7 to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 are going to my parents’ house and @CAPS7 online to see when it opens .@CAPS8 found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 cheak it out and its nearby so @CAPS8 are so read to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle tooken away. Today is the day @CAPS8 are on the road but what @CAPS8 did realize was how many people would be there. When @CAPS8 got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! @CAPS8 sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting @CAPS8 were in the to @NUM7. It was just own luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but @CAPS8 were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 use the rest room so @CAPS8, walk across the  street so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up in the top @NUM9!@CAPS8 waited another @NUM10 then @CAPS8 were in! By the time @CAPS8 were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants ( he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didn’t do anything ,@CAPS8 had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if @CAPS8 were not so patient.",24

19392,My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.,12

18751,"Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient.",23

18110,"A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my present’s there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the day’s got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didn’t even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didn’t get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and app’s and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. That’s why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision that’s the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but it’s some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..I’m happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. That’s why??? can play it because I’m saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one.",20

17868,"Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad.",15

19124,I was patient when I was in school when my teacher left the room. The kids started going crazy and they were standing on tables. Throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper in the @ORGANIZATION1. The kids were screaming and I was just sitting there waching as the teacher comes in and sees what is happening. I am just sitting there as I am amazd how stuiped they are acting. Then I am waching them get in trouble and get calls home. I am thinking good thing I was not part of it because I might get kicked from the cross country team. The kids are getting suspened for lunch. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness  thet can get the kids in even more troubley.,17

19346,"“@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?” I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes .One of these, I hoped was the letter. “@CAPS2 yet honey ,” she said “but there’s plenty of bills to go around.”  I wanted  to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said ,”  just wait long  enough and you’ll get what you want”  I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesn’t sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results .Pretty good system ,huh? No ! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!",20

But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, “You have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also.",21

All the presents were under the tree and I couldn`t wait to open. The parents were just talking about nonsense, so I opened my big mouth and said “can we open presents now,” we stated to open the presents but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gifts openers ever I was about to rip the presents out of their hand`s and open the presents I didn`t do that thought because I was being patient. After they finished I said,”yes” of course thought my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you they aren`t fast at all either. After that I finally got to open my presents. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @NUM2, and over @MONEY1. That was the time I was patient.",18

Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important.",16

I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait.

18355,Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is ??? your ressence aterring his sweet time. You don’t want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that would make you not get the job. So in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life.,7

And another time my mom waited in line under the rum it was burning the only thing she did to cool down was drink for about two hours under eithy one degrees an she was still patient.,14

19106,"When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still don’t understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, “turn! Turn!” but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. “@CAPS1’s okay. You almost had @CAPS1!” mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before @CAPS1 was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didn’t let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!",24

19052,"Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1’t control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “@CAPS1 I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!",24

18423,"I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it.",18

18945,"“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you.",24

17841,Un Patience @CAPS1.   My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that’s when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.,16

19355,I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.,22

19507,"Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn’t sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted.",17

18754,Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result was. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5 an defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player and the @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents.,18

18726,"Being patient is important, as I’ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn’t get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1’s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend’s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldn’t fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.",20

As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on  was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we weren’t even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks people’s seats said “go!” and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient",23

19214,"I have been patiencent a lot of times but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! Thats alot of patience just for one ticket its @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It’s hard being patience it exspecially when your are going to meet a celebirtly that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patiencent a lot during this process of saving up money. No matter how hard its going to be I can do it with patience. My friends and have been patiencent and still are. I meant could you stay patiencent if you were goning to meet your favorite celebirty that you love? Well it’s not that easy first off it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money that really sets you back. But like said no matter what we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tat to meet him and we are going to be patiencent the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patiencent. Overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life.",15

When I was little I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that, but after I badly hurt my ankle and was pat in a cast and on crutches for four months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say “patience is vertue,” have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience? Well its really just the ability to control your self, you have to be able to get through tough situations and still be controlling yourself, and you really have to control yourself when people annoy you of things take awhile",12

Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores she dozent get very upset she just ask me to do it again. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she does not get frustrated when  she has a lot of work to do like writing  a @NUM2 word paper,11

19061,"This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   get’s you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you’ll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can’t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don’t hurt their feelings if they can’t do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don’t get in trouble. If you wouldn’t have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That’s why you need patience.",15

Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the @CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any  longer than that puts me over the edge. On by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a @NUM1 hour drive turn into a @NUM1 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish icould have more patience but I don’t know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story.",15

18326,"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them.",11

She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking.

19539,When I had to go get my check up with my asma or and a familiar way like that when I had been waiting in the waiting room wich had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn’t call your name yet. So I had gotton myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes wich were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader at the same time a writer but I mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name but I was still busy doing activities then he had said he was sorry a bout  the wait which took a while and just said it had been fine and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me fell really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or sitters. But to me it doesn’t matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience.,14

I know this sounds like an easy task but it really isn’t. Time after time again my brother attempted to tye his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I will teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes but no! He could not make the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps but no, he was determined to tye his shoes. After about an hour of tying he finally got it! He didnt tye them perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tyed I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course I walk over and tell him just cross the two bunny ears and loop around but he didnt get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didn’t get it. We hit the half hour ??? for the double ??? and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When it came back my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudley.",21

18369,"Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever.",20

So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn’t break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays,",20

18295,One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.,16

18694,"Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”",20

19470,"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten",15

18899,"Patience! Being patient can get you want and I gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It @DATE1; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didn’t get it. I waited another week I still didn’t get it. When my birthday came, (@DATE2) I finally got my matai scoot! I was so happy! That’s why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!",15

19195,"Click,’ “ok, cool grandma thanks.”  I say “your welcome.” @CAPS1 says. “When will they be here” I say. “I don’t know.” @CAPS2 you don’t know what @CAPS3 talking about, which you probably don’t, @CAPS3 talking about my shoes I just ordered online. There called @CAPS4. And boy was I goin crazy over these things. I waited for @NUM1 days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time l did, they weren’t there. I was starting to get mad. So finally l rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a @ORGANIZATION1 truck and I thaught on yes hes probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day l look up online were my shoes were, and it said @PERSON1. MI. I was flipping out that meant they were coming. So again @CAPS3 wating, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So l went in the car to leave, and I thaught l heard the truck, but nope so we finally arive back at my house and l looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front ?? in a rough brown box. I run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on (@CAPS6) they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my patients flew away. I felt so happy.",24

19213,"I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life.",12

18294,"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you’re quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you’re waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren’t doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you’ve lost, and you’ve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I’ve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I’m trying to say is that when you’re patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn’t a “bundle of roses” all the time, so soon or later, you’re going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn’t human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, I’m certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.",16

19410,"One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I don’t want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, I’m not sorle years old, I’m muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying “your mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said “was you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story.",16

19504,"My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for “@CAPS1” to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldn’t wait to go but I remembered to be “patient”.  The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to “@LOCATION2” when were in the car on our way there I couldn’t wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldn’t wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.  I had to nare patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states.",16
