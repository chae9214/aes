18142,"“@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!” my poms coach @PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didn’t even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didn’t get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldn’t believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced “@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon team” then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasn’t so bad anymore.  It was all worth the wait.",21

At the end if they made  it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient.",17

I have, just @DATE1 I took the @CAPS3.A.T to get into the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also know as @CAPS8, (@NUM1-@CAPS9) I had to wake up at @NUM2 am, on a @DATE2, to get ready. I had to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took @CAPS10 @CAPS11 to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the, we all got solo way afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day!",21

19563,"A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!",15

I stood for ten ?minutes then I started thinking maybe I could cut. But no I didn’t. It felt like an hour had gone by. I was still waiting s trying to be as patient as possible. Then I relized the line was moving quicker and quicker. Until I finally got my food and ate. I had only five minutes of recess but I was just happy to eat. Patient is by,16

Mom said I got to go get dad, wait in the car so I went and waited for them for like a minutes. When they finally got out dad asked ?????????Shouted @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He said ok and we went. when we  got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about @NUM1. I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour. Before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient.",17

18319,"“it’s where?”  The woman asked for the third time. “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didn’t say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often don’t meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  “@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.”  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of young’s incorporated.  “@CAPS3, you’re with young’s?”  @CAPS4 asked. “  Do you know where the show room is?”  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.”  I said in a robotic voice.  “@CAPS6’t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?”  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  “@CAPS8, sir.”  “@CAPS9 old are you?”  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  “@CAPS11, sir.” I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high ?schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4’d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. “Are you getting paid?”  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  “yes,  sir.  But it’s @CAPS12 a lot.  It’s more like volunteer work,  really.”  @CAPS13 don’t ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  “thanks son.” “You’re welcome.”  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think we’ll both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dad’s shop, because if @CAPS4 didn’t, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient.",24

When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home!",17

18153,"Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.",24

19222,"I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him.",17

19212,"There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will intrest you most. Finaly we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is “paradise” little did I know that there was the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides they were for every thing. In two days of fun it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave “paradise”. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up.” @CAPS3 we are home”. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer then we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (dans it no video games). That is a time I displayed patcience.",17

19209,A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasn’t one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I’ll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. That’s a time where I was patient.,17

I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world.

We where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me… she pinched me. Then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. I know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why l think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave.",20

One day  I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. And to make it I bad the clack was drare and I had  a planned schedule of my think day. When one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way I can stare at the abat and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall.

I was patient throuout this time because if wasn’t I might’ve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.,20

When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave.",16

I didn’t want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting fo over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset.  They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time.

18924,"I think patience comes into role in a lot of places. For example you have to be patient to get a job or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, thats not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you don’t just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait.",10

I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it weren’t a turtle.

18143,"When dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. Elderly often @MONTH1 become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks @MONTH1 be hard for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. That is how I feel about the word patience.",13

18626,"“Patience is a virtue.” You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Here’s a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, I’m going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, it’s very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1” services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I can’t deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pro’s and con’s of having patience thank you for reading my essay.",14

It kept going throught my mind @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so l just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silence orthodonist office. I kept asking myself things like I wonder what their gonna do today, I wonder if I'll get my expander off or what about my top braces. Then l starting to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out ""@CAPS1"" l was excited and nervous at the same time but l was proud because l had sat there the whole time patiently.",24

From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience.",20

The lady at the front desk called me up. “I’m sorry but @PERSON1 won’t be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that you’d like to do your @CAPS1?’ A perplexed expression spread across my face. “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?” I asked. “yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o’clock. “she suggested. “that’s fine.”  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining.

When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them.

If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience  but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is.",11

We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didnt catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home  we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour.

When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes later… I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasn’t worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride  move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient.",16

18855,"The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it.When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient.",14

I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do.",17

When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the subed in until finally I asked my coach if a could go in. his response was you just got off. In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in. when I got on the field realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient.",17

My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient.,11

Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didn’t know @CAPS13 mom was on the coach. “@CAPS6, go put the clothes in the diver”, called ?? “@CAPS7.K.” I ??, “(@CAPS8 want to come down stairs to.” “@CAPS9” he exclaimed. “@CAPS10’ I thought in @CAPS13 head. We walked down stairs in the ??? to the laundry room when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” @CAPS5 look frightened and said “@CAPS9 I’m cooking something. “@CAPS13 eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened @CAPS19 and @CAPS14 pushed me out side hare coms. “@CAPS10 air!” we m joined. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen.

For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt.  @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes.

18062,"A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience.  My classmates and I were divided into groups at differents areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the differen characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it. Our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, “@CAPS1 @CAPS2!” as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!",17

When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got their we got checked in and there was alot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient but then he finally came then I was all done!

17959,"Patient is very hard when your waiting for something you want. Very hard when your waiting in a line that is very loud or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days. If your not a patient person that cant wait for the simplest thing that will only take a while then your a very impatient person that cant wait. If you are a impatient person then you are selfish, mad, and evidently not patient.",7

18304,Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.,13

I was to at the time I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing in one hand and a bag of salt and viniger in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my friend bubbles a norweigian goose he was also out maybe a week old. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guessed he liked warms so I gave him all my bait put down pole. And as soon as I grabed my chips… I had a bite! I turned out to be a very small sun fish. But still to this day I see bubble once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had some side kicks two ducks I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. There are very friendly and love skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or a bench. And bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true. The @CAPS3.",16

18892,"Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you.",17

18200,"Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2… @NUM3… @NUM4… and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!",19

He started to get frustrated and tired   of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 kept his self busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn’t realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called   in @LOCATION1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into his the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep.",17

Let me tell you what happened. “@CAPS1 class today we are going to add negative numberC” @CAPS2 @CAPS4 going to be a breeze I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and @CAPS7 teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When @CAPS7 teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost “ @CAPS3 are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,” said @CAPS7 teacher. A few minutes later she went to every student and checked there answers. When she got to me she had a worried expression on her face. “@CAPS4 everything all  right you didn’t do your sample problems” she asked me. “I dont understand @CAPS2” I replied. @CAPS7 teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said “come see me after class” @CAPS5 I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. “I noticed you were having trouble with math today” said @CAPS7 teacher. “@CAPS6 were gonna fix that.” @CAPS7 teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it I finnaly began to pick it up. @NUM1 minutes later I was doing it. “You can go now” said @CAPS7 teacher. “You now understand it better than the other students.” “thanks for being @CAPS5 patient with me” I said before I left . @CAPS7 teacher just smiled.

I was at the begging at the line and then I saw a sign that @CAPS3 two hour wait from that point. But I wasn’t that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we must likely have to wait at lest two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasn’t the smartest @CAPS4. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldn’t take standing in that hot wheather anymore but I really wanted to rive that rine so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patent then I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a line that I was paitent.,16

My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said “its gonna be a long @TIME1 so rest up now” at first I didn’t understand. But after she explained to me I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2 so waiting is not really my thing.

My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there for ever! Me and my family were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. @NUM7 ½ hours later. It cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at @NUM8 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patiente. The game ended at @NUM9! we only stayed till @NUM4.00 though because of the drive.

My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient.
