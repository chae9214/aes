18765,"Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had. After that I dont think that I want to go on a roadtrip again.",18

I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice. “@CAPS2 this is going to take forever!” I whined. “@CAPS3’t be so negative. It’s not that long.” @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. “@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game?” @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS7, when you’re patient, you get food!” @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home.",24

I was patient because the whole intire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friends parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and icecream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watch my friends cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 my friends mom said not to night because my friend has a volley ball game in the @TIME1.

18339,A time I was patiet was when I was wating for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School end’s at @NUM1 so I had to wait out side for an hour and a half almost. It was winter at the time so it was about @NUM2 f degrees. It was vary windy too so I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But that did not help much becaus I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot choclate then @DATE1 then it was florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was vary hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient.,24

19415,"A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There is multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach your mind has to be patient when you wish you do things but you really can`t. your body has to be patient when it feels like your ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have.",13

18690,I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it. That's exactly why l believe patience is important.,11

18051,"You being patient is important. People should always be patient &not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time & wait. People need to understand that it you are not patient then particular things want happen to you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, shayna was not being patient because she wanted on get on the dance box. But, she could`nt because a lil girl named @ORGANIZATION2, was on the dance box & shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when you we get our attitudes. Shayna got mad & started to cry & roll her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS1 she now up to me & said, “she want let me get on,” @CAPS1 I said, “@PERSON1`@CAPS2 , you have to be patient & wait your turn because she was on it first & that would be rude and unfair to make her get off.” @CAPS1 @PERSON1`@CAPS2 apologized & they both took turns on the dance box. But last, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 was happy & she learned her lesson.",18

We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn’t know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teuch him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient.",19

I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!” “@CAPS4 can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2’s mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he’d still be game for you.",24

19505,"Patience is something is most people don’t have. In the story, patience was something that I needed. If I didn’t have patience in the story, I don’t know what I would do. This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I don’t, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasn’t out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didn’t let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasn’t mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story.",17

I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menu’s and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasn’t frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.",19

We dint have to wait a long time , @CAPS1 my ride we ??? to wait a longtime  to get on @CAPS1 my friend  was very patiente and I was not. I kept complaining on how long it took. @CAPS1 eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, @CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world.",14
19174,"Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!",21

18823,Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.,16

17873,"A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldn’t wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandma’s cottage I didn’t complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient don’t go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person.",16

She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And fonaly her patients paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home and put the dress on.

She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the gold paint. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs and every one stared. It was @CAPS3 best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce him self and when she turned around he fell in love. @PERSON2 couldn’t believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her will you marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true.",24

He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didn’t work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly.",21

18904,"Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something then you don’t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn’t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn’t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now",14

19081,"Patience. Wow, you want critism; are you sure? We’ll since you asked for it,  it looks like I’m have to give it to you. Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you’ll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want.so that is my story about patience explained my way.",9

There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “@CAPS10”. @PERSON3 said. “@CAPS11 a metaphor?” @CAPS10 answered. “@CAPS13 you’re right it was a metaphor.” “@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!” @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath.

18600,"Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. “@CAPS1 you can get it this time.” I encouraged myself. I stored at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap!  I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I think. “You got this!” my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd. M y hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the  court. Since I was patient @NUM1 didn’t give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory.",24

17923,"Some people say that if somebody’s trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but thats not always true. One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It’s really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides he’s going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didn’t really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didn’t have to the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn’t always work.",21

Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always woundered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn’t wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn’t like other children, couldn’t wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2’s too. She couldn’t wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that pacific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lips glass five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she wen’t up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, that’s how accedents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience.",16

Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dad’s house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I don’t really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because it’s implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun??",24

She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework., chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isn’t that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she’s resting and not making man of mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the days because all she bad to do was throw them back into the toy bar. Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldn’t open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didn’t wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all that’s been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldn’t because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time.",16

She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldn’t get it out and said that she would have to at in out, I had screamed.

18978,"I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she’s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they’re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I’d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. It’s too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1, that’s not nice, please stop.” @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:” I realized tothem that’s like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn’t believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!",24

Now, here’s a time I was patient. After @DATE1, I decided to buy on ipod touch. Since no stores were open, I had only one  other option. Online shopping. I used omazon to get it. I couldn’t wait to yet it! Unfortunetly I had to wait like a week to get it. It was boring waiting for it, but I had other things to occupy my mind. When it finally come, I was so happy! I was glad I waited. From the patience, I learned you cant get everything rite away, I learned that people who wait, good things will come to them.Also I was better at waiting for everything. That’s how I was patient and have bin better at being patient.",18

Patience has Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. When they got to the hotel Patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. The whole patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that to, Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is patience story of being patient. I hope you liked it.",18

19044,Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.,7

I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off.",23

18499,"Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement. I had asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I wouldn’t be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, “@CAPS1, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.” @CAPS2 I sat there slummped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens @CAPS7 the time, I thought my @CAPS1 would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunatly, with every flip, I became more irretated. “@CAPS3 is she? Why is she taking @CAPS2 long?” @CAPS4 like these swirled in my head. Then, my @CAPS1 came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door crecked open. My @CAPS1 started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasn’t going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes. Taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. “@CAPS5 passient.” I told myself. “@CAPS5 passient. Relax, you’ll make it there.” @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself “see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient. Great job”",24

18030,"I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months ?old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when “her baby,” @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it.",21

18588,"Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks.",23

It we didn’t understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I’ve ever ???,17

The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. That was the time I was patient.",17

19559,"A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events. Soccer practice friends home and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know.",16

17845,You know that life is so much harder when you don’t have the patients. If you don’t then I’m going to tell you why. There was a time that found out I was going to @LOCATION1 now that’s the good part but when I ask “how are we getting there?” we had to fly and right then and there I knew I was going to have to be very patient and I thought I didn’t have enough patients to fly to @LOCATION1. Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patients and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn’t want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha I came to my sences and I start out it was why easier to wait and the bus eventaly showed up and I already felt way better.,16

A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!",17

One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me.",24

Waiting there in a dark room was hard, I picked up a near car magazine and started flipping through it, @CAPS1 the interesting thing was a article about a new @CAPS2 coming out. I read that in @NUM2 I went to the bathroom, and really soon was back in the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple people. Five minutes passed and answer no I close my eyes and layed my head back so I waited and waited. Right when I was about bash my head on a brick wall my brother enters the room and says “ That’s it “.And then I got a text by two people, it would have been better while I was board out of my mind!",17

We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.",22

So I fell asleep. When I wook up no one was up. So I still had to wait.

The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience.",24

Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. “@CAPS3 on!” @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet.

18233,"Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not your normal. @CAPS1-@CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help  you in the long run. I f you and I were patient our would would be a  little  bit fasier. Like  if your brother for an instint was in your bathroom and you had  to use it. you  could wait for him to finish. That is saving  argueing and it’s  being patient. I say these thing like “I’m patient!” but that would be  a lie, because I am far from it! Not saying it’s  easy but we all try.",10

18000,"The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane’s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3.",22

17900,"There was one time I was patient when my little brothers play station wasn’t working so it took a while to get use to it. It was an @TIME1 and my little brother had jus finished eating and he wanted to play his @CAPS1 but he was having a hard time turning it on but the problem was that some of his games were scratched up. But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new. So as he tried the games he still couldn`t do it.

18991,"This story is about a time when I was patient. I was about @NUM1 years old. It was a gorgeous day outside. The best part is that it was my birthday. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try and ride my bike with no training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet would let @CAPS9 go. I went @CAPS1 through the front door and I yelled “@CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS7 quickly I have something to tell you.” “@CAPS4 is of buddy” my @CAPS2 screeched as she ran down the stairs. “@CAPS5 is @CAPS3” I yelled. “@CAPS6 is coming.” “@CAPS7 on sweety you have gotta somewhere @CAPS4 your son wants us to here it must be important.” “it is, it is, it is,” “@CAPS7 on mum we can meet him outside.” “@CAPS8, we will be outside” “ok” “@CAPS7 on lets go.” @CAPS9 and my @CAPS2 ran outside to wait for @CAPS3 and that was a time that I was patient.",17

18334,"Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself.",16

18827,"A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side I’m on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, “@LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time.” @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said “@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true.” even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didn’t move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends.",16
