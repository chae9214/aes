12841,"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed.",4

He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"".

The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden ? red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window.

The way Narciso described her home, explained the sacrifice of her parents, and her definition of ""family"" all added to the overall mood. Narciso's description of her home and neighborhood expresses the passion she feels for it. She used phrases such as: ""I am eternally grateful"",""passionte Cuban-music, and ""which I adore to this day"" to express her positive feelings towards her childhood home. When the author ends paragraph two with ""life in our warm house"", the reader knows she was pleased with her childhood conditions. The sacrifices and selfless actions of Narciso's parents is purely uplifting. ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage... they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Their actions are touching and heroic - adding greatly to the up with the mood of the memoir. The author's definition of a ""family"" is very touching as well. She expresses that """"family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" and the way her neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity.""  @CAPS1 this neighborhood was united and supportive of one another - the kind of place that anyone would want to live. I believe that the last sentence displays the mood nicely, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighbor hood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important.

There are many examples of this in the memoire.

The mood of this story is happy in the author really shows how much of the love their parents and what they did for them. In paragraph two when they talked about how they love Cuban music and the culinary skills that their parents had, that was passed on to them and that they love so much. Another example of the mood of the story is shown by paragraph four when they talked about all the people they had at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people that they met through where they live. The mood of the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was happy and loving to all the people this person has ever met from that house.",3

13471,"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author.",3

12246,"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.",2

In the memoir Narciso talks about how his parents had successful lives in Cuba but came to @LOCATION1 so Narciso can have a better life. Narciso even said, ""they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give there children a better life..."" @CAPS1 was thankful that his parents sacrificed everything for him. Rodriguez said, ""... even though it meant leaving behind their families, frineds and careers in the country they loved""Rodriguez was also thankful for his parents turning ""this simple house into a home."" His parents made his house feel warm and cozy. @CAPS1 leared the real definition of family living in this simple house.At the end, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1 could never be able to thank his parents for what they sacrificed for him",3

First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes.

An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had.

Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money.

This shows that just because your  not related by blood does'nt mean your not family.

I can now smell, hear, and picture  the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally gratefull."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen.

They mostly were memories of good past times and how he grew up in a loving and caring family. To prove this in the first sentence in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3 his parents sacrificed their hopes and dreams that shows they love and admiredness toward the author.",2

For an example in paragraph six he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice."" This shows how grateful he is to his parents. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborey and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborely outlook. so all of these reasons explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez.",2

13268,"In this excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's book, home just reading the last sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" reveals the true mood of the memoir. The mood the author gives out in this excerpt is warm, comfort and happiness. In the first @NUM1 or so paragraphs, Rodriguez describes his simple apartment that he first lived in, and how really, it was nothing anyone would consider special. But as the memoir goes on, he talks about how his family and friends is what really turned his little house into a home. His parents created a traditional Cuban home, which mainly consisted of the kitchen and how cuban music, and traditional cooking always went on. What really established a sense of warmth, community and happiness in this memoir is when he talks about how you didn't have to be a blood relative to be considered family, everyone was welcomed into his home. All were immigrants though, hardworking immigrants that created this close-knit community. Everyone's arms were wide open, so to speak. The great act of giving thanks contributes to the mood displayed within the memoir. The last few paragraphs state how Rodriguez's parents came to @LOCATION1 very selflessly to give their own children a better life than they had had even if it meant struggling with their own personal hardships. The author talked about how he admires his parents and appreciates everything they had done for him and how their teachings of family, traditions and welcoming anyone no matter what their background really did turn their simple house into a home.",4

Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home.",3

One reason why the mood is unity is because even while Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved from Cuba to the United States they stayed together. After they had first moved to the @LOCATION3 they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play. Another reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because, when the Rodriguez's were first living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became family. And paragraph three it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A synonym for solidarity is unity, so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood. The final reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because even after all of these years, Rodriguez ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" To this day, his family is still united and they all still love each other. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is unity throughout Rodriguez's and his family's whole story.",4

One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her.

Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them.

13093,"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir.",4

13275,In the memoir the author made a certain mood. The mood he made was loving and very alive. He constructed the mood of love in paragraph @NUM1 where he talks about the memories of his house always filled with comforting aroma of food and the passionate cuban music playing.  It also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the back drop of their warm home. Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph @NUM2 where he talks about how he was always surrounded by love ones during meals. He constructed mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there. In conclusion this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir.,3

In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Growing up in the enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you. The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows the love that everyone has for one another. Lastly the excerpt states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This part makes you feel warm and happy about family.",4

Another reason, was that you should always help your family s during bad times. For example the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporilily until they were able to get back on their feet"". Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance the auother quotes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.",3

The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir.",2

This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 the authors use and repititon of the word ""grateful"", or ""thankful"" creates a mood.Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS2 this quotation the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration.",4

13451,The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.,2

For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love.

Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home.

An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood.",4

He also thanks them for his childhood. He thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in. When the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents. He tells how even though his community was made up of many races they still lived in friendship and unity. He tells how people always came over to house for dinner and there were many celebrations. He tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture. He describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives. Narciso describes how his parents had great jobs in Cuba, gave those up, and took any jobs they could find in @LOCATION1. In paragraph six he says how he will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also in that paragraph he says there is no way to express the graditude he feels towards his parents. The last sentence of that paragraph he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" There once again he is thanking his parents.

Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood.

12047,"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude.",2

13079,"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child.",4

I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir.",3

One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on.

12877,"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meain to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skillsIn one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows the mood of greatfullness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story.",2

12529,"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir. ",4

11954,"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beond comperashin seening as they had to start over from scratch steping down far benith there potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the famley but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 ""… Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants…"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close ? knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessary their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise. His parrents also kept their doors open and alowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throghout this memoir that illistrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness.",4

His parents was very skilled in cooking, which passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph @NUM1, ""… A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about @LOCATION1, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph @NUM2, it explains what the parents had to. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents realy loved their children wanted them to be happy. Finnaly, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" states how the narator feels love for his parents and his home.

I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well.

12803,"The author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family. I know the author is thankful for his parents because in paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 reason why I think she is thankful for her parents is because they made their liFes worse to make the authors life better. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever they could find."" The last reason why I know is because he basicly says it in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM3. It says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.

He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure.",3

11933,The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about.,3

Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents.",4

The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home.",4

13022,"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming. loving place that holds so many memories.",4

They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice"".",3

12003,"The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful",3

12941,"The mood of the memoir is very warm, happy and inviting. Since the whole story portrays this mood, I will tell you some reasons why. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez tells you how everybody in his neighborhood were good friends and would always give a hand to people in need. Paragraph @NUM2 goes into more detail about paragraph @NUM1, telling us how many of Rodriguez's neighbors, friends and relatives joined him and his family at dinner on a regular basis. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In paragraph @NUM4, Rodriguez states how his parents selflessly came over to the @CAPS1.S.A to give him a better life. They give up everything they had just so he could have more than his parents did. This just goes to show how much Rodriguez's parents cared for him. As you can see, this is why the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and inviting. (Also heart warming!)",4

13409,"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

11867,"The mood that takes place in this article would be sorrow, excitement, and being grateful for the parents he had. Narciso is grateful for the culinary skills and traditions that his parents passed on to him. Just like me most of my life I lived an apartment and saw it as any other home because of the parents you have there that care for you. Also growing up in that enviroment taught him family doesn't have to be blood related, it could neighbors or friends that could be like a brother, sister, aunt, uncle.",2

""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" @CAPS1 you picture that in your mind you create a very warm, tasty, good-smelling room, which helps create a mood for the whole memoir.

They had a good life in cuba, they had good paying jobs, and they had a nice home, and a nice huge family there and i bet they didn't want to leave. but it was something they had to do for their kids benefits. So they moved to america, and they left their home and their good paying jobs, and they also most importantly left their family. that im sure they are going to miss like crazy. In this passage he (the author) was the most thankfull boy ever, and he was thankfull for his parents sacrifice and how they came to this country with such courage and NO knowlage of the language of the culture. but they came to give their children a better life even if it ment leaving behind their family, friends, and carreers in the country.",3

12069,"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old @PERSON2 and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2-room apartment."" @CAPS1 example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the appartment to look like a traditional-cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lot's of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and carrers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. Those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir.",4

13363,"I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home would love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood relaited, it's about being their for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loveing home, filled with family and love.",2

When @CAPS1 says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regulary joined us at our table."" @CAPS1 refers to the supper table when @CAPS1 says, ""our table.""

In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"".

My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring.

The mood he sets throughout the memoir is love, selflessness, and gratefullnes.

My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood related, they still consider themselves family and cared for each other beyond belief. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved and ended up facing many hardships to their new country. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefullness. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his cooking abilities, his love for cuban music and for his parents love and sacrifice.

In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son.",2

13115,"The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood.",3

The author talks about his parents generousity, selflessness, and caring ways. In the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet. The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life. If that is not a heartwarming mood I don't know what is.",2

And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like its Cuba. In my prospective this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart.",4

The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times.",4

They all came together and had fun even when they had different backrounds. You hade to make as many Friends as you could to help you live a healthy life.          Another mood that was created was calm. In the house there was ""Passionate Cuban music"" and the air smelled of traditionally Cuban @CAPS2. This was because their family was Cuban so they wanted to keep traditions and make a better environment.             The last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice. @PERSON1's Parents had to give up a lot like family, friends, job, and have just to move to @LOCATION1.

The authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united.

It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. @CAPS1 acknowledges the troubles @CAPS1 and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, @CAPS1 learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants.""@CAPS1 understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ORGANIZATION2 struggled personally and financially. @CAPS1 became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. @CAPS1 adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. @CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. @CAPS1 had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds @CAPS1 created with his parents and the refugees amongst them.",3

I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life.

For example, the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" makes me feel sad because he grew up and everything is just memories now but he keeps those happy memories. Most of other ideas like ""I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" also carry the same reasons for being happy or sad. However statements like ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" makes me feel happy that his parents were so determind.

Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go. They had open dinner where friends and family members came. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him.

But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" The author understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on him, and his gratitude for his family contributes to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family, and tells them of his ""admiration for strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir. Narciso uses careful selection of what memories he writes in his memoir, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close-knit to make the love within his family stand out. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the focus of his memoir.",4

I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from.

The first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that everyone in their community loved each other and help each other, which added to the mood of family and love. The narrator also tells us of his parents that ""they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they wanted the absolute best for him no matter where it took them. This shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author. The final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and that it was from his parents that he ""learned the real definition of family."" This shows how much he loved and respected his parents which added to the warm, loving mood. In 'Narciso Rodriguez' several things used by the author create a warm mood of family and love.",4

This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful towards his parent's because the author tells the reader that what they did helped him become a great/better person. Lastly, when the author tells the reader that he is grateful for the fact that his parents gave up their life in cuba to make his life better. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (paragraph @NUM3). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and greatful because he expresses what his parents did for him and it shows that he feels greatful that they did that. The author creates a loving and greatful mood toward his parents in this memoir.",4
12959,"Based on the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is very so grateful for his parents and adore them so much. And paragraph two it states, ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" @CAPS1 more, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for there children. In paragraph five it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carreers in the country they love."" @CAPS2, he thanks them and admires their strenght and preserverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" As you can see, the mood of the memior created by the author could be described in many ways. ",3

12128,"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.                                                                                                                                                    The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""",3

""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" One more way the author reinforced the mood is with the carring in the story. Narciso cares so much for everything his parents did for him. Also, how his family would let other relatives stay with them and care for them. Lastly, all the culture helps the mood. The description of the cuban food and music and how they celebrate creates happy thoughts in the reader's mind. As you can see, the author was very good at creating a mood.",4

12225,"@ORGANIZATION1 tells the story of his childhood and the feel good-times of his family"" in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family"" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author. The excerpt recreates a feel good time of a carefree life and worryless days that provide a wonderful atmosphere for the reader.""",3

The many immigrants gave up their lives in cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children even though they did not know the language or culture. The @CAPS1 will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. There is no way to show her thanks for her parents love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, and showing her the importance of family and friends. The @CAPS1 states ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They didn't just change it, they did it through love and friendship.",4

Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music.

I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life.

When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate in not getting good jobs.

They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing.

Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud cuban. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 he talks about how he loves cuban food, cooking, and music and how he is grateful for all of them. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him.

For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you.

They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well.

The first example is ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life"". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. The third and final example is ""It was here I learded the true definition of family."" Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his ""family"" and although he didn't know all of his ""real"" family he was happy with the one he had. Those three examples show the mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"".",4

12615,"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created.",2

13530,"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind.",4

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, greatfulness, and respect @CAPS1 has towards his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be greatful for their love and sacrifice"", meaning the sacrifices parents made for their children. @CAPS1 also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseference... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity..."" @CAPS1 cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much, that @CAPS1 bases his life on them and will never forget them.

His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are.

12079,"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful.",3

This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location.",1

However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hardwork and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents.",4

Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). You can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir.",4

12413,"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you.",2

12644,"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir.The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment.The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family."" Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community.Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community. These three themes set the mood of this memoir.",3

13569,"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family.In this memoir there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking. ""It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent in music but life in love"". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"".

He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir.",3

13456,"In the excerpt ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" from Home: the @CAPS2 of our Lives, the author gives off a very nostalgic mood. Throughout the excerpt @CAPS4 recalls all the feasts, parties and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1. This tells me that the author had  very good memories at the house @CAPS4 loved and grew up in. The author also gives off a very compassionate mood. In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""  @CAPS4 describes his comunnity as ""close-knit"" and ""honest"". This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community ""extended a hand to people who were clearly in need."" @CAPS4 calls his parents actions of coming to @LOCATION1 ""courageous."" @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immagrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives. Those are the moods set by the author.",4

Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that ""also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home.""",3

From my point of view only loving parent would give up The country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers.

12292,The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life.

""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in @CAPS1 @NUM3, but then later on, we see the family moving to @LOCATION1, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4).

But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness",3

In paragraph @NUM1, he says: ""… All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close ? knit community…"" This quote explains how much he valued his friends, neighbors, and other family members; and how all three of these categories formed the house he called home.Secondly, the mood of the memoir was not only centered around family and friends, but Narciso also showed much gratitude toward his parents. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life…"" And the later in paragraph @NUM3. he says, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice.""

He mentioned how thankful he was for his parents since they were willing to sacrafice things in their lives for the benefit of their children. The author made the reader feel like Narciso was protected in the house he lived in because all his neighbors were so united with each other that they were all friendly to each other so there was nothing to worry about.

12184,"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close ? knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1).

13462,"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir.",4

This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.""

He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family.

He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen.

12530,"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when @CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

I believe the mood is grateful because it is mentioned by the narrator many times like during the third paragraph where he mention how grateful he is to have parents who made good meals and taught him how to cook. Also he said he was grateful for being introduced to cuban music. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because although the hardships are mentioned it wasn't about how they struggled but how the concoured the hardships they faced when immigrating to @LOCATION1. Another way this memoir is happy is because he talks about how happy everyone is and how family makes a house turn into a home it just touches your heart and gives you a sence of happiness. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a thank you letter to the narator's parents.

The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir.",3

Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many, many sacrifices. He describes his @NUM1 ? room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing. Narciso explains how many people in his neighbor hood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family.  ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many people in his neighborhood joined Narciso's family for meals and this brought many of them closer. At the end of the memoir, Narciso explains how greatful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to give him a better chance in @LOCATION1 despite their hardships.

""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family.",3

With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they.

In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home.,3

It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me.""",1

Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage… I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him.

The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed alot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then @CAPS1 could've ever done and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immagrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life. The author learned the real definition of ""family"" and for that, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful mood.",3

12810,"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness.",4

It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir.",4

12741,"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story.",4

All of that set a very happy backdrop for the family. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there was always people over and having a fun time.

I felt this way because by familiarizing your readers with your characters, that makes writing the rest of the story a lot easier. For example, in paragraph two, I was able to get a sense of what his home and family life was like-especially with this line, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" @CAPS1 line that I felt was special to the story was, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need"" I liked this statement especially because it showed me, as the reader, how caring those people were.

For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. These are the moods that was created by the author.",4

12766,"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the @CAPS1 is Warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when ""Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well.When Rodriguez @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up @CAPS4 nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compasion at this point This is the mood created by the @CAPS1 by @PERSON2 from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives""",3

Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head.

Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times.

(@CAPS1 @NUM1) Also this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to familys of friends who need a push or help to stand on their feet once again.

12831,"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphisization his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. @CAPS1 talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing @CAPS1 kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way @CAPS1 talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states @CAPS1 can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that @CAPS1 would not be who @CAPS1 is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home!",4

Also he is greatful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was greatful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family."" the last mood I thought was happy.

The first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate  Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents  always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home.

The community was like a big family, ""the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means.

12989,"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author.",4

Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness.",3

So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed.

The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" From this quote, I can see why the author is grateful. His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country.Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other.The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't. I think it's reasonable the authors should be grateful for his parent's courage.In conclusion, I believe the mood of the memoir is gratefulness, because the author's parents have done everything they could to make it easier for him.",4

He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice.

This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, @CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly."" This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece.",3

In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.""

The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life.

The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good).

When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy.",3

12486,To me the mood of the author is happy. Thinks he's happy because in the article it talks about how he grow up and where he lived through his entire life. Also it talks about when Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States which was in 1956. Plus it talks about how he helped the poor people in his own country before he moved to the US. Narciso Rodriguez did alot of stuff to help his country survive before he left.,1

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance.

12537,"In this memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez enstills a kind of loving mood and a strong feeling of gratitude. He is thankful for the fact that his parents sacrificed their happiness and family for the well-being of their child's (Narciso's) life, as shown in paragraph @NUM1, where it says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, Narciso gives a feeling of admiration for his parents. He admires their courage for leaving all the wonderful stuff in Cuba, as he says in paragraph @NUM2: ""I've often told them [his parents] of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""All in all, Narciso really shows a feeling of love in this memoir.",3

13004,"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness.     One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful of his culture.       Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has.      Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are.",4

Like it went slow then fast than slow that person couldn't controle her writeing in the story out all so mood was like think fast  then think hard and good nex time the writer should stay at one speed why then readers give up on the story. Who know's that story could of been the best but Just didnt want to stay at one speed. See me @CAPS2 not the one to talk because I cant write has good but i do read and very welling so take it from a reader not a writer. Also the story was to plan like any other story bad before it gets good I think if the writer he a she would of went slower with describeing the story and would of been different but the frist @NUM1 minoter I was like oh this is like any other story @CAPS2 gona stop reading right now boreing and rush the answer be careful how you write or choice these stories you dont know whats best fo me I do.

Throughout the excerpt, it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family, his life in his home, and his overall life living in @LOCATION1. Reading this makes me feel grateful to live in @LOCATION1. It even mentions in the passage that he's ""grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It uses words such as ""warm"", which here means friendly, ""aroma"", ""rich"", and ""solidarity"". All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this mood. In the @NUM1 paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to @LOCATION1. And then it talks about his gratefulness, to truly show the contrast between sacrifice and the state of being grateful. Those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful, or gratefulness.",4

He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his family. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home.

It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over which finally became family. The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence in the author put the family's location in a non-american neighborhood.,2

The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..."" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three room house he called home.",3

They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away.

And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.",2

""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

12247,"As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.",3

Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet.

That makes the memoir a happy mood. But there is also inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are, family is family, people who love and care about you the most.",2

Narciso is thankful for all that his parents had sacrificed and taught him His overall tone in the memoir is translated into a happy and peaceful mood. Narciso writes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calm and friendly, as Narciso explains the happiness of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with celebrations for family and friends, it constructs the peaceful mood of the memoir.     Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Here, Rodriguez adds to the peaceful mood by speaking of generosity, and care towards family. It is the idea family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood turns to gratitude as Narciso thinks his parents for giving him a better life, though they had to endure difficult jobs and conditions. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The concepts of family, love, and generosity Narciso learned from his parents formed the basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his life.",4

The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting.",3

The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a feel of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even says  ""love."" His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly in his memoir.",4

13076,"I think the mood that is created by the author in this memoir is cheerful and welcoming. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is explaining how their house was always open to anyone that ever needed, all wanted to come, which is a very welcoming feeling. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The movie is creating when he is saying this is very cheerful because he is very happy and grateful for what his parents did for him, and by him showing that it makes the mood cheerful. In paragraph @NUM3 he says, ""they came selflessly, as any immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind the families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" When he says this, you just get this nice, warm feeling because they gave up everything they loved just so that their kids could have a better life. This gives off a very happy and cheerful mood. In conclusion when the author talks about his family, and his life he gives off a very cheerful, and welcoming mood.",2
13250,"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Narciso writes ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 loves the people that @CAPS1 calls his family, even if they aren't really related. @CAPS1 talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and it Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents. Narciso aknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where she learned the defenition of love, and how grateful @CAPS1 is to those who taught him it.",4

13607,"In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one.One example on how its warm is how he discribes the home. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1. ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet eromahs of delicious food in the oven.A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of theus cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was alot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together.The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he apreciates what his parents have done. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever don."" This is saying that he is greatfull that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life.Thats why I think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice.",4

13001,I think in some parts @CAPS1 was happy. And then is other parts @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is talking about her first house in america. @CAPS1 is happy because @CAPS1 can look back on the memories and be happy.,1
