13052,"The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home",2

Narciso also includs little sentences in parentheses explaining what he had just said or telling how grateful he was for it. This happens for example when Narciso states: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows how he is greatful his parents taught him how to cook, which he still does today. Narciso also shows his gratefullness by making it abundantly clear how gratefull he was to have parents that taught and did so much for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez created gratefullness as the overall mood in his piece. the did this by showing how thankful he was to have parents who taught and did so much for him.",3

13160,"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961… @NUM1 ? family, blond ? brick building… created our traditional Cuban home… very heart… kitchen… rich culinary skills and a love of cooking… Passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen… innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends… endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (¶ @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain ? like when you're sitting around a campfire with friends and/or family. This feeling is created by the author's language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what really conveys it. In conclusion, the author uses language appealing to a readers sense of safety, warmth, and unity to create a warm theme in his memoir.",3

Paragraph five states ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved.""

For example, he says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarely until they were able to get ba- ck on their feet."" It is very genorous to help some body in that way. Over all Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture. Cuban culture encompasses cooking & music, but most impo- rtant ly family, having nothing to do with being a blood relative, but the fact that you have respect + love for everyone.

From this quote you can tell that the author held his community in the highest of regards, as family. I describe it as thankful because based on this exerpt, you can determine that the author was taught family morals, and was raised in a household rich in Cuban culture. This mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home. The author learned the significance of his Cuban heritage, and the sacrifices his parents made to come to @LOCATION1, which in no words can he thank them enough for their selflessness.",4

13334,"The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (¶ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (¶ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (¶ @NUM3) @CAPS1, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (¶ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations.",4

12071,"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents. ",3

In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.,3

12405,"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez described their childhood home. The author creates a mood in this memoir.The mood is created by description of the kindness of his neighbors, his gratitude toward his parents, and how his house was turned into a home. The mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors. Narciso talks about his neighbor hood, calling it ""a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Narciso is getting the point across that his community was a warm, loving place, where everyone was friends and there was no conflict. Narciso also talks about his gratitude towards his parents. He says that, ""They came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Here, the mood is set as grateful, since if his parent had not given all that they had had, he would of been in a worse situation in Cuba. Narciso sets the mood by talking about his home. He says that, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was often some one staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This adds to the warmth of his home, giving in a warmer environment.The mood in this memoir is set by @PERSON1' parents' determination, the kindness of his community, and the open arms of his home. All of these thing are the definition of family.",4

13262,The mood was to show it was a comftorble feeling. To show about a family and how a family would take care for you and what not to explain what lifestyle makes someone feel great to make the feel safe and not live in a life where it will just wither away from you. That is the mood I think the author is trying to set,2

Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america.

He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious.

Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it.

As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.",3

""Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity"".

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done.""

12439,"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving.",3

The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were.",3

Also the mood is gratefulness by how the family keeps the arms Open for people who need help because they knew that their friends/family would do the same; from paragraph @NUM2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" There was also a depressing mood because Narciso family had to move from their friends and jobs to have a better life for the child/son; from paragraph @NUM3 ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also they're grateful and Admiration to do what they did came their; from paragraph @NUM4 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family.,2

13124,"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood.",3

13252,I feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons.      My first reason is Narciso's parents came to @LOCATION1 from Cuba just to make sure that there kids will have a good life.       Another reason is his parents did hard labor and worked really hard to make he a good life. They also made there house feel like a home for their son.            There are alot of thing Narciso is grateful.,2
,,
,,
,,
13173,The mood of the author i think is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighbor-hood. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on. But I think it is calm because the way the way that he speaks it's in a calm tone.,2

(@CAPS1 @NUM1) In that @CAPS1 he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it. He also says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences. @NUM3. They care about their children @NUM1.) They're not selfish @NUM5.) They're not afraid to make sacrifices and @NUM6.) They can adjust to new things and new surroundings. @CAPS3 by everything I have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those.

13106,"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love.",3

The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.",3

13585,"In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir.One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They admired when their parents helped and teached them how to cook. They would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or backround. In the story it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking.""When the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy. In the story it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet.""@CAPS1 example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @LOCATION1.

13577,The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story.,1

11978,"In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to @LOCATION1, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs. The author says how he can't put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to @LOCATION1. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life.",3

12233,"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir.",3

That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back.",1
