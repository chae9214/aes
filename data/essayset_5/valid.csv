Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them.

Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children.
