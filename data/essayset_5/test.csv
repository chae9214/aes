This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. ""It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez.""",3

It's nice how the blonde-brick house was better but still the same as the house their parents lived in. The Cuban music filled the air of the house like it was a house in Cuba. A house isn't a house untill you call it a home. That family has made that their home forever. Even though their family can't come down till 1970 they too will have a place to call home like Narciso Rodriguez did. Like he said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home"".",3

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well. This is an amazing piece of work.",3

There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love.",3

As Narciso talks about his parents' Cuban background and tradition, by his tone you can tell how proud and happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir.",2

Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood.

And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"".

For example, in paragraph @NUM1 they talked about how others who aren't even related to them come to do different activities with them, while still touching upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970. The author also shows how even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in the @LOCATION2, they were still able to keep their Cuban culture going along with the music they played and food. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure.",2

In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"".From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherish this time, and would love to go back.",3

I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story.",2

That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1).

13386,"     In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods @PERSON2 created were happiness, humor, and kindness.     The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh.     Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness.     Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.     In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family.",4

The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two. The mood is described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture. This evidence is located in paragraph @NUM1. The authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet. His/@CAPS1 parents did this so whenever they needed anything than they would be alright.

Throughout the memoir it talks about how Narciso was grateful to his parents for their ""love and sacrifice"". He was grateful that they wanted to move to the United States from Cuba just to ensure that he would have a better life. He learned generosity and how important family and friends are from his parents and they have been ""the basis"" of his life. His house welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with ""not just scent and music but life and love. He learned what family really ment and learned how to love. He loved his parents a lot and talked highly of them in his memoir ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.""
