The author understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on him, and his gratitude for his family contributes to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family, and tells them of his ""admiration for strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir.

Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude.

One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love.

Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you.

Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love.

12393,"Based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction. It was filled with love and satisfaction because Narciso and family loves everyone for who they are. People from all over came and be apart of the family and it was alright with them. It said in paragraph @NUM1 that growing up in there environment instilled in them a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In there neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. They were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso said that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Narciso had a loving mood because he is grateful for what his parents done for him. Last but not least in paragraph @NUM3 Narciso also had a mood of love and thankfulness because he learned the real definition of family and love. Narciso proclaimed, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.",4
12715,"The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt. ",3
