880,"Dear, Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 @PERCENT2 of the people would agree that computers are useful and by having them they help ability to learn about faw away place. They also, allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are importat @CAPS2 people that work with them. there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places. Sometimes people, dont know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Somoe people like my family, like to go visit their familys in other places, @CAPS2 example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @LOCATION1 is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places. Such as , @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION4. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, facebook that you can and people that you probly havent seen in a long time. @CAPS2 exsample, one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @PERSON1. I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again. I am @PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them. Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer. Such as scientists they all have to have computers or else they wouldnt be able to invient all the great things they make. Also, secretaries they have asign dates @CAPS2 their bosses. @CAPS2 exsample, a secretary @CAPS2 doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers, they wont be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. @CAPS2 the reasons that they give the ability to learn about faw away places, allow people to talk to other people online. Computers are very important to people who work with them.",10
481,"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. ""I was so releived to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part @ORGANIZATION1 society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?",10
299,"Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well I don't I think @CAPS2 is on easier way to get information faster. The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer, business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. These are many other reasons but I'@CAPS1 only required to talk about three. First of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to out on newspaper until the next day. If you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways, @CAPS2's just a better source of information. My second reason is to have a job in the computer business. There are alot of jobs that require computers. If we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs. Also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed. That is why computers are needed. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the some if you get to talk and see the person. Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to. If we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you. That would be a terrible thing. In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information. You can learn about faraway places. You can have a job in the computer business. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, I think computers are a positive thing.",8
452,"Should there be computers in are society. Yes, there should computer are good things and are good help. I can give you @NUM1 good reasons why. Paying bills, facebook, and research. This is why computers are good. My first reason why computers are good is because people need to pay bills its easier to pay your bills online then to do all the paper work, and it makes it faster for people and computers are really good for them thats why we need computers. My second reason why we need computers is because people have facebook. And thats a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends and its fun to have facebook and just interact with people and why computers are good in society. My thrid reason why we should have computers in are society is because research and need to get info from and an computer is really good help for that, there great help for research like an specific topic the computer has all that. In conclusion having computers is really good because of paying your bills, facebook, and research, so people need computers so I told you all good things about computers can you tell me yours!!",7
539,"Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.",9
865,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration.",8
446,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less “cyberspace” bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says “@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they don’t. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diebeties. It’s imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening. “In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don’t go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that use the socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying also my sisters friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on advil so @CAPS3 ran comitt suicside because of cyber bullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled and should ""go die in a hole."" @CAPS3 didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing website than less people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. My final reason is, the less time you use your computer the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and spending more time on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the peabody museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity was invented. In addition, @PERCENT3 of power used in todays homes is used on computers. Also my grandmother is astounded by what todays technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. @CAPS3 believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends. Lastly, it's extremly imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health their self estem and environment. A case take action to stop using computer @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper.",10
1331,"Computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker. Since then, they have been updated over and over untill what they are today. Computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.But the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? My answer is yes. Computers do many things for us. They teach us hand-eye coordinatin, give us the ability to research effectivly, and recently, became a great way of communication, @CAPS1's are definately benefitting us. One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination. In a magazine I read, one expect, (@PERSON1) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. The speed that you type is improved with practice. Another way it improves hand-eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. I often on being ammused by playing games on the computer. These games usually are hard, but with my improving hand-eye coordination, I am learning how to play these games well. My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future, soon, mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy, it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society. Our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand-eye coordination. Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper, just a click away. My garndfather always tells me how easy I have it. Instead of going to the @CAPS2 and having to pick out a book, I just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me. When we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed. To keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear to read typing right infront of us. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. This way very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. Computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. The last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away. A couple weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. Me and him meet only once a year. With that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. Recently, i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. It is almost like he's with me. All the girls in our school can't get enough of me. So I get home after sports, go on, and theres always enough of me to go around. Webcamming is a great way of communication. With all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop. Well, the question still lingere, are computers benificial to our society? The answer @MONTH1 never come about, but at least for me, improving hand-eye, researching being a breeze, and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal. So for now, I stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone.",9
1773,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. ",8
544,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people, are that computers are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family. But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist in @CAPS1 opinion, this would have been better. For example. children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age middle schoolers and high-schoolers should be focused on their grades and their . But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities, and their grades start to slip. Even sudlts have this problem. For instance, buisness people, accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cudical all day are almost always on the computer. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut dwn on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information. For example, people could insect their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information they dont know if their information is correct. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't beat books or history. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons of it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet too much and because educationally computers can sometimes give false information.",8
1787,Dear - Local Newspaper I agree thats computers are good for society. Without computers a lot of things couldn’t be done. Computers are sometimes the easy way out. And thats why I love them. Computers almost makes anything possible. Now say if your an elderly person and you cant get up and your bodys really bad. Well all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. All you need is a computer. Computers are also good if your lazy. You can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things all youll have to care about is personal hygenic. Sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you. No more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss everythings a-okay. Computers are also swel because its the eazy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer. Not and old one because it can breakdown. Dats one reason why computers arent so good. But as i said computers are very good they might be a little pesky but ones you get the hand of them everything gonna be alright and remember you can do almost anything with a computer.,7
52,"Dear @CAPS1 of society I am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. My first reason will explain the many ways computers help you @CAPS2 beleive that people using computers is a very good idea. They beleive this because computers make you really focus and pay attention. This gives you really great eye sight and amazing hand eye cordonation. A important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on were you live. The reason people would probobility want to visit one of these places on a website would probobility be for vacational purposes. My third reason to why I feel we should keep computers is. There is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online. IAM, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 exc. These are all great uses for computers. Also people who own a well paying email system on these computer that tells them who wants to sell a piece of machinary, or anything that involves buisness ethics. Now you know my three very important reasons to why computers are a great way to get hand eye cordonation. A great way to learn about other states. And so you can talk to friends and have a email for buisness purposes. I hope you have enjoyed reading this and hope to see you on my side toward this topic.",7
1644,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends.",8
1545,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stateing that people spend too much time on computers and not getting enuff exercise well I have that their are a lot of people useing computers and they are gettiing enuff use. Im going to explane why within the most few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more. Same use the internet for ingredence, car parts, ect. Next, useing computers is very helpful to the human race because it will effect students school, parents/guardians/teens. It will effect and lots of schools are useing computers now and exspecialy students to do their. It effects parents, beca use it will sucess them in life and help them find jobs, with their jobs. Finally their getting enuff exercise because their going to bed, their eating, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing those days. Theirs always something to do or a place to go. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration. Thank you for your time, and just remember your job is done on computer too.",8
1554,"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.",8
1467,"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been belaming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are conserned ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information arte you in an upcoming geography uses? Are you planning a trip the for you do you need to find a definition for the word ""cognitive""? of @CAPS1 pertain to you, a legitamite website house your and all you need to do is search. Instead of having to travel to learn about special wonders, for travel prices are expensive and you can simply, click and type to and amazing at your searching on a computer, you can learn about long ago cultures and rituals. Information you would find at museum @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 complex simple to use technological a world of pictures simple, art and history right at your fingertips.",10
492,"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing. I personally think that compueters are a bad thing. Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more innapropriate things than I ever even knew of! The @CAPS1 and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet world @MONTH1 look like fun and games untill someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says! In conclusion, as you can probally see I am really not a fan of the computer. The reasons why I don't like it are kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing innapropriate things in it, and it has been used for injury and sometimes death. These are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing, so remember these tips, take this article into consideration.",7
1058,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.",8

But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It's less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn't have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The @CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful.",9
370,"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?",10
979,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even, bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out in exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the sea west effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you don't want to surromb to the computers. put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in @LOCATION1 is at an all time high. Experts agree, that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. @PERSON1, an obesity expert, says, ""I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of @CAPS1."" @CAPS1 can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! @CAPS2 you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. Theyre too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew @PERSON2, a park ranger, says. ""In the past few years. we have had less visitors than ever before."" @CAPS2 people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national, there is obviously something wrong. Get off you computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say @PERCENT1 of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology supervisor says. ""I have seen as definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around"". She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers @MONTH1 not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people a though computers do contribute to the problem. @CAPS2 we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn of the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll, @CAPS3 you do, know you can have fun withour computers.",10
625,"Wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? Going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! Personally I think not going on the computer benefits you, @CAPS1's more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! Certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. For example, lets say you went on the computer for an hour, that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calleries! Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise, are in risk for health problems including obesity. As you can cleary see going on the computer really isnt the healthyiest choice to go. Most definatly going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer. A girl named @PERSON1, from @LOCATION1 ""I love to enjoy the beuty of the outdoors that god gave to me I wish I knew that years ago while I was a lazy woman on the. If you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy @CAPS1! Everyone wants to live like there dying or in other words live life to the fullest! in order to do that you have to see life and go out there and experance @CAPS1, not sit on a computer! Without a doubt this world is gorgeous and @CAPS1 is worth while to see the nature! Everyone knows that family comes before everything! For example, you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family! One day on a @DATE1 night @PERSON2 was on the computer and her mother called saying, ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1's time for dinner"", @PERSON2 ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer! Now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! I know with my heart and saw that my family means the world to me and everyone shown more time for each family member, not the computer! Its now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! With no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! Most importantly @CAPS1 will not only benefit you but @CAPS1 will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and spend some qulity time with your family!",11
689,"Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you dont have enough money to visit them because they live to far? Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism has scientist found out or something in history you've never known before? Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just havent got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half sister who I only get see like once a year or once two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on facebook. There is also websites people use to talk to loved ones like twitter, myspace, yearbook, aim, skype ect. Not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them. Alot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that @NUM1 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" and that time when a teacher went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few typing you got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like @PERSON1, the city that was forgetten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in which to be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never new. Would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher!",8
1065,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I do not no where to start this letter. Im writing you this letter to let you know that I think that not everyone should use a computer. My first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school. My second reason not everyone should use a computer is because they @CAPS4 dont spent time with there parent. My third reason they shouldn't have people use the computer often is because they would get sick. My firs reason computer shouldnt be used often is because they forget about school. They forget about it in the way that there so distracted writing or chating or playing @CAPS4 that they forget about school. @CAPS5 reason is because their grades get low. They dont do homework either. My second reason is because they dont parents. Are more could be there so the computer they dont. My third reason is because their get computer there get @CAPS4 they dont and not @CAPS5 could that they dont get no education for being in the computer. That is why is bad to use a computer a lot I hope u understand.",7
1747,"Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.",8
177,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer. And it is a lot more fun to learn of off a computer than a book. For intinst, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn. Another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away. Like me for instints, I live far from my friends. And the only I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with Family. Lets, say your childre go on vacation and wants to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send and its at the other computer instintly. But, if you was to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. But, most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games, to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash macromedia is the best though. You get to make your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. a computer has so many advanrages in today society. Which i'm very thank full for computers and all of the great stuff you do. That is why I believe computers benefit society.",8
818,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are bad for society. It came to my attention that many people are concerned that computers are not very good in my opinion I think computers are They help typeing skills. Computers are also very helpful with and crofing pictures, and they make it to find information. First of all, computer are very helpful with typing skills. Other people doesn't use computers takes six years to @CAPS3 younger people like young skills use very quickly. Actuly @PERCENT1 of teens can type in a minutes Who takes @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a great effect on many people with their typeing skills. Computers makes it so copier with so many pictures editing and many more, editing pictures from a expensive digital @CAPS2 it for free on your computer? A computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster. The computer you can look for information make faster. For example you have to @CAPS2 a project on @CAPS4. Instead of going to the library and spending more on a book about @CAPS4 you can go on google.com and type in @CAPS4. So much information and so much faster. Get with the program computers are in. In conclusion, I think computers is a great invention. They make it easier to find information and typing skills. Also they make it so much easier to crop and edit photos, please take my suggestions sereusly.",8
174,"Coumputors are mind browning on what they can do. They can make or break somone financhely. They also can perduce amasing graphis that aritist cant perduce. Coumputrs are also for great for recer antal acitivitys, and they also take your life away. I not talking about a real life @CAPS1 talking about the activitys you do away from home. Now lets see the benifits and problems we come so far on how we handle money. We use to put it in chets and hide them now all we do is click and type in a securty number. people can also invist in items but invisting is tricky you dont always win. You can win small or lose big they say @CAPS2 coumputers today are hd. The screens are made of a liquid crystal fourmula that hardens. The lights in the back pixels do most of the wort to bring stunning graphis to life. On coumputers today people make money by selling graphis they made on coumputers. So this would be another plus on what a coumputor dose to a human. I went to a school to lern how to perduce great graphis. All teens kids and adults have used a coumputer for recerantol acivitys. On todays coumputors you can play games watch videos, and listen on coumputors. People do this to engoy then selfs. Some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web. But there is nothing stressed out and just playing some games for a while, personly I like to go on youtube and find funny vidos after school. I use to own a youtube account and get many views. The worst thing about coumpurts is it can ruin plan gobo or somones socal life some people get addicted and cant stop being on the coumputor until it is takin away. For example some people play world of war craft get addicted and cant stop! I had a problem when I had to chek you tube a lot. Well I hoped you readers. No matter what happens I think coumputors bennafit more than the problems",8
791,"@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and i just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside and we don't even or talks to our friends or family any more. Local newspaper i think that we should have computer but not because many people aren't doing anything. Many people aren't exercising because their taking on facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together gofly kites. What im saying is that yeah people like computers and go and talk to there friends and play games but its destroying the parents and and even families. i don't think have computers. Also local newspaper we need to go and the @DATE1 and go doesn't happen. many children go they're on the computer. many parents go hiking, camping, swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore. These people need to get a change. What im talking you guys is take the computer away or. One last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time. Maybe if and parents weren't all they they would pick that might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have two together like lake or six flags. many parents that they get computer because it's so fun so they. Many people world complain about it. So i think everybody should be off computers. i think we shouldn't have computer society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature and you hang out or talk with friends and family so i think computers gone now.",8
1241,"Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alot of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remeber the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alot isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad wnet on a @NUM1 weeks buisiness trip. You could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with.",9
1595,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easyier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes home work, and finding information a lot easyier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1 friends. Even if the are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them a @CAPS2-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your home work down, you can go online, and ask one of your friend what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes home work much easyier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly belive that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you.",8
339,"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 a “home on your town; all you hear is, “mom, mom , mom drive me to the library to get books”. You see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money. Is this what you want every home to start looking like? Computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another. You can learn about places you’ve always wanted to go to and it is probably the device that makes your life easiest. For these reasons computers are what benefits society most. First of all, computers let friends and family talk without spending a nickel. I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk this means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone, but a computer costs nothing to use. Also, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1 @NUM2 a recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone. I know some people say that computers are too time consuming, but if this many people use computers to talk, there’s no need to worry about paying phonebills. Also, @PERSON1 a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4 says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting. This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phonebills and just talked online. Furthermore, just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @LOCATION1. What’s more is that they can be in the bedroom or room. A boy name @CAPS3 @PERSON4 who attends @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to when he was little and was as when he looked up @LOCATION2 and facts and pictures on the web. Also, @PERSON3 a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1 task a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries and @PERCENT2 of them they did. That means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it. It shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands. Last but not least, computers are just about the convenient thing to have in a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 at people would rather have a computer than a car that just shows the important computers are. Also, I used to think computers were bad for you and everything, but when I received one for my @NUM3 birthday, I found out how useful they were. Many people say computers are time comsuming because they haven’t used one yet. Also did you know that million people use a computer that’s more than half their population and such a poor country? That shows her important computers are and how convenient. All and all, now @CAPS1 have if happy residents, laughing on the computer they do because computers allow them to talk with friends learn and visit foreign countries and are so convenient @PERSON2 and readers computers withour a doubt benefit society.",11
443,"Dear @CAPS1 I support that computers have a positive effect on people because they have so many things to do and learn on the computer, because on the computer you can look up many things like sports, animal world history and lot more. The reason I support this is because I like to look up history about @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneer who have changed humanity. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. @CAPS6 third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @CAPS2 revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @CAPS2 revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and @CAPS5, because when I'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. I also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example I like football, basketball @CAPS6 idols are @PERSON1 peterson and @PERSON2 iverson, so everytime I go on the computer I look up both of @CAPS6 idols. @CAPS6 last reason why I say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is.",8
1216,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finnaly, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dont know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary.",9
280,"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They even allow people to talk online. Computers are a very usefull piece of machinery. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. When your in school, you need to type lots of @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your application essay for college, you will need the help of computers. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. @NUM1 years ago I look a trip to @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8. In just @NUM2 hour I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country. Computers allow people to talk to online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! @CAPS3 networking sights accesible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that @MONTH1 be true to some people, its not true to everyone. We still exersise, and spend time outside. We still interact with family and friends but know we are also able to do so on the computer. More and more people using computer is a good thing.",10
123,"Every where you look people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing and almost all of our @CAPS1 work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got. Because of saearch engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. The person you're talking to phnes only give you audio and that doesn't give you the some thing. video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far way and you cant him or her, you can see them through video that socializing through computers is pne of the best ways to talk to people. Our @CAPS1 is mainly run on computers, without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an on coming attack or threat. The @CAPS1 uses computers to store thir legal files of court cases laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The store market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our @CAPS1 and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize and they help our @CAPS1 and economy. Computers are essential to our way of life.",10
869,"In my opinion computer ars benefit with the socient here are my s reasons, I can talk wit my friends, I can do my homework, or I can do olner things in the computer to. First reasons, I can talk with my friends or I can talk with my family on facebook or myspace o his on msn or I can se my family in the camera msn the camera is allot of help with me because lik my family is in @LOCATION1 I chat with them every @DATE1 instead of sending pictures and videos or going visiting to @LOCATION1. Next reasons, I can do my homework on I can write a big letter on I can do a lot of work in the computer is and easy. Final reason I can do a lot of things like find a question or do project on.",6
49,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?",6
117,"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you think computers are great for everyone? I think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever. What's really great about them is how much you can learn from computers. You can learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to people. Surely, read on to see why computers are very important to us all. Many people think that computers are bad for our mind, but actually they're not. When on computers you can learn hand-eye coordination. You can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper. Lastly, you can even have fun, relax, and type out your papers for reports. Definitely, read on to see what computers can @CAPS1 too. They're a lot of faraway places that have their own specil way of showing you a great time. On the internet, that have a list of vacation spots or places that grab your attention to visit. They give you details on why to visit it and a fair price. Think about it, would it be cool to visit a great place, like @LOCATION1. Without a doubt, continue reading. Have you ever wanted to play outside but it was raining or your friends were not around. Well, on the computer you can talk online to your friends. You can see how their doing or what their doing and still have a good time. Not to mention, you can even make new friends. Lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends. Surely, you should agree that computers are great. I think computers are very unique and important. That's why so many kids to adults use it the computers so much. They use it to learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to other. Thank you for reading my paper local newspaper.",8
222,"Computers and the @CAPS1 have changed the way the world works today. From stocks to instant messaging (@CAPS2) people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read. Although some people believe that computers are pulling people away from the beauty of nature, relatives, or exersize. I believe that @CAPS11 is only helping the world on a day today basis. One example is conversation, many people have close relatives that but over seas, cross country, or even across town. The @CAPS1 helps them speak to others that they normally couldn't have a conversation with. On several occasions, my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent. What could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the @CAPS1. Another way to speak to friends or family is a website called @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is a website that allows you to speak to, @CAPS6 or send pictures to others. Other websites like this are @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have an account on one of these websites. One other way to speak to others, more for business reason, is @CAPS6. Multiple servers proud @CAPS6. such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. ""@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal favorite' says @PERSON2 @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper, ""@CAPS11 has helped me endlessly if need to contact someone on short notice."" That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. ""Even though I still use books,"" college student, @PERSON1 said.""The @CAPS1 is so much faster and the articles are more up to date. Search @CAPS13 are most popularly used, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com @NUM2, of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have @ORGANIZATION1 at some paint. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program is used from everything to research papers to. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a check for mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complain that people have been spending too much time on the computer and @CAPS11 has been distracting them from the important things in life. Such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the @CAPS1 increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates. As for exersise, @CAPS11 is commonsense to spend as little as one hour working on personal fitness.",9
1508,"Computers. Theres fun. But there's also a down side. People spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family. But on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids, and even help get together from dating sites. It makes them happy. It's fun! Computers are fun. They provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. You can play role playing games (which and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. Some very adults have and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy. They do this hundreds of a day. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way.",8
1603,"To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, advantage so why not use it? They give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends. These days people even watch to shows on the computer-websites such as: @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People make emails, download music and several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2 even @NUM3 move use computers-play games on them. i have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time he even knows how to search something on the computer. Some people @MONTH1 think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people think that should comee to the reality. We have to step up as the life goes. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer, her parents think that computers spoil children, their technology spoil children. The girl goes to school, her friends asks her to give them her e-mail. Every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. this time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse. Then suppose one day her friends finds out she doesn't have a computer and embarasses her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to see around you and go on with it computer also saves your time. You can just type instead of writing whole out. You can make your writing cursive or any other that you would like. After reeding my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you.",8
1483,"To: @CAPS1 this letter concerns, Computers are apart of our daily life. You can do many things on them such as play games, watch videos, search the web, and even communicate with people from all over the world. They are very useful for people who go to school bacause you can complete and save work for your classes. Sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to. Computers have a massive affect on some peoples life. Sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways. One of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on. That is why I think the computer has a great effect on people.",6
909,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you all @MONTH1 know many people in our town have been quarreling about computers. Some people are pro computer useage and others not so much. In my opinoin computers are a great @CAPS2 technology. One way computers benefits our society is ability to access ample information, pictures, and news. Also you can chat with @CAPS2 or old friends. Another good thing about computers is you can also have fun on the web, watch movies, even go shopping. Have you ever done a report on on a far away country? Maybe you've never heard of @LOCATION2 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. So wat do you do? Serch the web! Instead of taking a walk to the libriary just serch one of the many serch engines such @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS5! @PERCENT1 of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household. @PERCENT2 of people can access the web on their cell phone! Can you believe this? Pictures are also accessable on the web. You could @CAPS12 just about anything in the picture search engine. Have you ever wandered about current events in our country or others? On certain cites you can live newsfeeds or an article about something @CAPS2 such @CAPS1 the earthquake in @LOCATION4 that recently happended. The internet is benefitting our society today. Aim is just one of many private chat rooms that is avalible to people. On these open chat rooms you can talk to people that are thousands of miles away. ""I was on @CAPS6 looking for my friend @CAPS7 and I found her page before this year we didn'@CAPS8 talk @CAPS1 much but now we can talk through face book we hangout and talk all the time!"" comments @LOCATION3 avid @CAPS6 user. Dating cites are now avalible, too. There you can meet @CAPS2 people a develope a relationship with them. Entertainment is everywhere on the internet. You can play a variety of games, watch missed episodes of your favorite @CAPS8.V show, streame live movies, watch viddeos on @CAPS9, and much more! Many people think there are only pointless games on the comuter but there are educational fun games @CAPS1 well such @CAPS1 @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and @CAPS12 to learn. Did you know that more than @PERCENT3 of shopping for clothes car parts and other things are bought an auction such @CAPS1 ebay and amazon? I recall a time when my dad and I was going to see or movie but we weren'@CAPS8 sure wat was playing or what times they started at. So we simply looked on the cinema's website. So now you now where I stand on the issue of computers. Computers are a great reference point, can allow you to chat with",10
872,"Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 The purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better. They have improved our society. Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Aside from that computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online learn another. Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers. Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still. Computer have also ourlives. From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible. As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives, computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necesary part of the twenty first century.",8
1230,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing.",10

You can look up vaction spots. If your tired of being home, then just go on the internet. These are things you can do on the internet. On the computer, there are many settings. Out of all of them, chatting is the best. You can be playing a game and still chat. If you chatting with someone, you can still chat with another person. You can chat with people from across the world. This is why chatting is the best setting. Computer helps the world in many ways. It helps kids if they need to research something. It helps the cops catch the bad people. The computer helps parents get from their children by vaction ads. This is has the computer helps the world. The computer does benifit our society.

1085,"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?",10
124,"I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesnt have nothing to do. I think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @CAPS1 or a @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 for that what to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are avery helpfull to people that like seaching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs.",7
239,"I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people spend to much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason why is because people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family ans friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is bacause they are spenfing more time on them then exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercis on it's still better then going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human will go way down. Another reason people should't spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via comuter, it still wan't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people waould spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer. We would be living in a much more healthy and clean word. My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer. That to me just isn't right because they covered he spending quality time with their friends and family, instead they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends then spending more time on the computer. even if you don't spend alot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it everyday until eventually it's all you do.",9
494,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them, that they aren't as helpful as the seem. They can cause an addiction, and create numerous distractions. First of all. many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a facebook, myspace, or formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences, that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace.. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiouty really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that, that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From @CAPS1 experience with using the internet. I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase or addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totaly gotten rid of it we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions to students. When students sit down to type their papers they also, many times, have another at the same time. Therefore they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only just make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause tou to loose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet. Therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time. All and all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which cause people to have anxiouty problems. They cause addiction, which end up taking over peoples lives. They create divertion that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative affects and they should be gotten rid of completely!",9
645,"The computer effects peoplelife by taking them away from their family and have is @NUM1 reasons why the computer effect the people lives. @NUM2) They do not know what is happening outside. @NUM3) Their family @NUM1). Their job. Please listen to my reason why the computer effect people lives! My first reason their they don't know what happening out ide because they are to much busy on the computer. Their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday, her and her because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their? Say no cause you computer. They family will get rewing. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening. They akk to feel like they are going to cause they dont have their computer. Or the computer shot doen and he cant enough money to get a electriction. Those were all ny reasons. @NUM2) they don't know what is happening outside. @NUM3) their family @NUM1) Their job. Thank you for listening to my reasons.",8
550,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be.",10
1421,"How does the computer effect people? @CAPS1 there are way's that computer's can be really bad and really good"", they're good. Because people who dont like writing usually just have a computer to type on. But people rarely do that, parent's and kid's stay on the computer not caring about nothing else but the screen the kid's stay up all night knowing they have school they dont even do their homework. I have proof my freind's, research show's, my mother also agree's. I suggest that you will agree on my opinion'. @PERCENT1 of my freind's agree with me because they have been through this, and they would'nt wake up to go to school. Dr @PERSON1's of @ORGANIZATION1 researched how parent's hardly spend time with their family. For example father's they basically always on the computer either working or looking up stuff. My mom say's that when she was younger she loved the internent. She never wanted to get off: @CAPS1 i hope youv enjoyed my opinion', thank's for even taking this time to read it. Thank's again.",6
278,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers effect people in a positive way. Computers increases our knowlage, lets us communicate with our friends and family, teaches us hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowlage. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time. Instead you can look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending on email to someone does not. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam. Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great skill. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer. Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful. Finally Computers help us get our news foster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news. In conclusion computers are very useful and help us increase our knowlage, communicate with people, help us with hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. But most importantly computers are fun!",8
843,"Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. But most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face. In conclusion I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play and talk to people. Computers are best all around helpful.",8
145,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are you adminitrating your loacl newapaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspaper are using computers for a variety of different tasks then @CAPS1 are thet not helpful? Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work. As a member of society, I knew I would not want to read something not typed anyway. The govermnet must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. Without computers signs, flyers, bussinesses, and even newspapers would not be possible. You are running late to work able to traffic on the hignway. @CAPS1 are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? You can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. Prctically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as facebook and aol, and even video chat. Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrater interact with each other with important message using computers. if computers are important to them, the @CAPS1 could they be destructive to society? As a western middle school students, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet this would almost be impossible. The internet allows research to happen. After reseach is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. Without the assitance from computers, ahving naetly-written and well-researched assignments would not be possible. To conclusion, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possiblr. Without them, newspaper could not print, teachers could not communiacte, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student I know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computer are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern?",10
1597,"North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects.",11
1151,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers. Now a days you can do anything on a computer. Such as, talk to friends, play games, even turn off your lights! But, what are they taking away from us? There taking away communication skills and is same uses creating cyber bullying. They also don't let us enjoy the beauty of nature and exercising. One out of every @NUM1 teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face. This way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face. This makes @CAPS1 more difficult for children to make friends, or even to do well is work intencies. Studies say by each upcoming generation the communication skills are decreasing by @PERCENT2. Eventually, if @CAPS1 continues to drop at this the will have a world that went. This style of communication has ever a new type of bullying. What have we do to people? You waste over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of your computer. in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the day. in fact, the percentage of people that have computer is much greeter than the percentage of people that do not only you exercising for yourself. The computer cant do @CAPS1 for you. Sitting in front of a computer does nothing for your body. You physicaly have to get up and move. Its good for your health, got fresh air. Coming to a point about fresh air @PERCENT1 of people who use computers at home are more likely telecom sick than people who doesnt leave you set seem for sometimes. Seeing nature like never before, I dont think. Yes you can look us the green spotted tree from on the internet, but its nothing like in nature and @CAPS1 is real life. Discoveries cannot be made about new species on the computer, a computer cant find @CAPS1 for your find @CAPS1. People are and less about the environment does to computer. They are seeing a picture not the healthy. After writing this I can te the that I was about myself and personal, which scared me the most I realizes I am becoming more and more dependent on computer each day. I dont seeing friends as. I dont go outside as much, and I don't as much. This true for must people whether you realize @CAPS1 or not I personaly ongoing today and out on time computing you will te. Computer are to much lets for from there hold and deo something more with there lives. This well improve our. So this brings to my final that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and for ourselves by doing not seeing. Thank you for your time.",10
261,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend to much time on computers. It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes, to a half an hour. But one hour or more, is too long. People could get sucked in by playing adicting games. Also by online chatting survices like facebook, myspace, instant messaging, and more. Another way, I think someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might start it lost minute. These are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game? Then you look at the time and its an hour later? Games are very adicting. you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by. Games are very fun, but they fry your brain. @PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day. I think, we should eliminate some games off the internent, so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends, not playing silly games. Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half? And that you have homework? @PERCENT3 of teenages on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internent. Facebook, myspace, instant messaging are all examples of this. It is okay for someone to talk to their friends, but you need to watch the time so you do not get carryied away. I think, we shoud cut down out use on these websites, so children and teenagers can get their homework done. Have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started? Many teenagers do this. They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due. They then, are stuck on the internent for hours trying to get it done. Which makes their grade lower then if they were to start it earlyier. @PERCENT2 of students wait till last minute to do their reports, on average, they spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should make sure that students start their report earlyier so it could bring up their grades. In conclusion i believe people have spent way to much time using computers, due to games, internent chatting, and reports being done last minute. I think if we elimate games off the internent, cut down use on internent chatting, and start reports earlyier, people will start exercising, hanging out with friends and family, get homework done and get higher grades.",9
133,"Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'@CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'@CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracks you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in @LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is @CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a @CAPS5. When you don'@CAPS6 interact with your Friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. The might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be @CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'@CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch you rkids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keepin gyou in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 eople are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screenplay games or sending e-mails, that's just as as palying video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'@CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exersice will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 realize. Secondly, @CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needds to stay healthy. For a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers!",10
160,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't undeRstand that they are missing of. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. Doing exercise is good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to work. Also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. Just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. Is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. People are forgeting about nature. They don't recycle so the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer they chould help so the world could be better. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. Is very important to spend time with your family. People don't realize thats the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. In conclusion, i believe that computers affect on people. People just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you heard my , i ask you to think about yours.",8
1017,"Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you.",8
1587,"Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exersice, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dont spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily schedued. I have a friend who exersices everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite. He hardly ever exersices and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exersice every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science poject because she was on her computer, rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostrisized because she didn't go to the reunion. High @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 says that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids dont spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier.",10
1043,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in @CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make @NUM4 powerpoints slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make powerpoint slide: on overage @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1 I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds @CAPS1 screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, @CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of @CAPS1 friend from camp lives in @CAPS10 so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.",9

1599,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3. Who knows, it will definetly be an experience, for sure.",9
519,"Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the @LOCATION1 have at least one and the number grows still. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintanence, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintanence costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. Thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is a quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for @CAPS4. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psycologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in a such a way, that most things they encounter are absorted and become normal. If a child becomes use to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problmes, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world, they take our money, our health and the minds of our children.",12
1561,"Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you feel about computers? Are they good or are they bad? I strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend to much time on them. I'd much rather spend time outside where I can excercise; @CAPS3't you? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. People could be lying and you @CAPS3't know it. To start off, computers take away from excercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run; I'd choose the run anyday. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead. I've observed that the average teen spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That's @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours they could be excercising or playing outside. For example, walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. Further more, computers cut into quality time with friends and family. I know you can video chat and instent message them, but @CAPS3't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are on the computer so much they don't know what's going on in their mom or dads lives. Theres is a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and much more. I garentee they will enjoy these activities more then staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremly dangerous. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on myspace and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. Once they put something out there they cannot take it away. It's also dangerous because it someone is applying to a school that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college. I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad. They keep people from excercising, spending time with friends/family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion we should get rid of computers in every house.",9
317,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do people benefit from the use of computers. Some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. I personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, help people learn, and allow people to communicate with others. The use of computers teach hand-eye cordination and reaction time. Some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hand-eye cordination. Alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important. These skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every - day life, personally, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has helped ny hand-eye cordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that I play. Clearly, Computers can be very helpful and can help your hand - eye cordination. Computers can also help people learn in many ways. There is a lot of content on the internet that simply can't be in school. The ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student. I use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has helped one as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @CAPS4 of hand writting. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. Documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost inlike a hard copy written by hand. Although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. Many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can communicate with others using computers. People use computer technology to communicate everyday through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I-chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practic is I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. Without computer technology we would function much differently. It is up to you to continue using computers. ",10
947,"Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it. What are they to do? Although many some say that computers are not good for society, most know that life without computers would be a disaster. New @CAPS1 is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town. This would be a big problem for everybody involved. One reason is that people need it to get information from search engines like ""google"" and ""yahoo"". They also use the internet for communication like ""facebook"" and ""aim"". Taking away computers would drastically impact every day life. Society computers to get information. I know that whenever I don't know something I just look it up online. If I didn't have this resource, my homework would not be as detailed as it is with the computer. Another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family ""e-mail"" is what makes it all work. My mom makes all her plans by email and sometimes even e-mails herself from work to remember things. Without it, our family would not be able to function. Another mode of communication is ""facebook"". Any time my friends and I have a question about anything anything that happened that day. We will ask each other on this website. It is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone. A final example is ""aim"". This is a messaging tool that lets you talk instantly with friends and even see them with ""video-chatting"". My friends and I would not be able to show each others outfits and other items without ""aim"". Teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers. In conclusion, society needs computers in order to look up info, as well as talk with friends and co workers. Do not even think about ",10
441,"Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of peoples lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothinggood comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time consuming from in other activities, computers are not always working which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what I have to say, their will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, your hooked and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken and out of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 of them said they felt groggy and had headaches, after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while your using the computer it's entertaining, for example, your on @CAPS1 and your talking to your friend and your laughing at them & enjoying yourself, but it's not the computer that's making you happy, it's the person, you might as well see them in person. There for, computers are time consuming & should not be used. Copmputers are not reliable, they have minds of their own. Many people do always rely on their computer and when it doesn't work it causes the person to get angry or frustated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration & anger is caused by non-working computers. If the use of computers was lowered anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not realiable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that, computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by the use of computers. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 says that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers they exercise. There for, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers effect people because they are time consuming, you can't rely on then and it's bad for your health. There for, computers have negative effects on people. ",8
1269,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She's beautiful!",11
1741,"Dear, local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like computers? I @CAPS1, computers help you learn about all kinds of things. Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make eveything easier. So, @CAPS2 consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer. You can use the computer to lock up your subject and a @CAPS3 different websites will come speed quick to your screen. Most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends. Secondly, @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!! you frogot what page of the book your suspose to read. Also you lost all your friends contacts. Not to fear super duper computer is here. You can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back. Did you know @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 People said that the chat & email programs are @CAPS6 because they can contact friends, family, and co-workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a @NUM2 paragraph essay takes to long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to microsoft office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. @PERCENT2 out of @NUM3 people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on @CAPS7. in conclusion, Computers are @CAPS6 tecnollogy when you have to chat to someone. Also when you learn about something. Another reason why computers are @CAPS6 is because you can type essays & papers, @CAPS8, @CAPS2 change you @CAPS10 of computers are bad to computers make us @CAPS11!",8
777,"Dear @LOCATION1, Computers are a neccessity to life. They benefit not only the community but the whole world! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet. Secondly, it's a form of communication. Also, computers can be fun and entertaining. As you know, education is one of the most important things in anyone's life. Where would we be without a computer to help? Think about how many times you've used @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 to search something you didn't know the answer to. It's a lot, right? I do research everytime I get a random question jammed in my head. Imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something. Another thing is there are online courses now for students. Some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page. Also, how world students know what their homework is if they can't check the @PERSON1 homepage? I check it almost everyday when I come home from school. It's great that the teachers care enough to post the homework. Without computers, we'd have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework. @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in @LOCATION2 has some form of online communication program. Whether it's @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, maybe even youtube, or just a simple e-mail, practically everyone has one. How else are yousupposed to talk to your friends after school? What do you expect us to do call them? Then wwwe would be on the phone for hours! Anybody with a teen at home knows that. Also, computers help deaf people talk. They just type in what they want to say and out it comes.I remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program. Another reason is teachers and parents use e-mail to talk about academics and their children. Clearly communication is a must have. Therefore, computers are a benefit to society. There is no way that anybody over the age of @NUM3 has never played a computer game sometime in their life. Except, of course, if they don't have internet access. I know I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer so my dad told me I had to stop or I can't use the computer anymore. Woops! Still, you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games. Oh come on like you haven't done that! Or at least your children have. Also, you can use specific programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business. In other words, computers are pleasurable. As you can see, computers are extremely educational. They provide search engines to figure out anything you're ever wanted to know about. Like, foreign places or movies. Anything. Also, we wouldn't have as much communication with people. How would we e-mail friends in @LOCATION3 without computers? Finally, you can find pleasure in computers. They are beneficial.",10
269,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that for too many people are 'addicted' to the computer, and spread more than enough time on the computer everyday! Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cutt off interacting time that families always and to have. @DATE1 @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 myspace, why don't you grab and plays family board game! Or go out to on restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interseted doing go to the same field have a game, or to your local base ball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also , with out being in school! As you read your brain to inner works, you or your so you can show off to you friends out family on words that you . It is shown that @PERCENT1 of strints who read . Not the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing reply .",9
363,"I agree that computers do benefit society because every one uses one or has one it helps you with important stuff the computer makes things easy. Computers, give exercise in a way it makes your fingers move faster. The computer is the best thing ever that happend to this world you can chat with your friends family, print writing play games. What can get better than that we can research a famous person google dead people look up pictures. But the computer makes you lazy because it makes you wana just sit there never get off of it its addicting to people but others just don't know the meaning of using or having a computer. If the others had an computer they would change there mind. You can go on myspace thinks to tom talk to friend family people from a diffrent town, state. You also can go on google yahoo, facebook, twitter the computer and internet is really fun and it give you a little exercise. And it helps you with your school work, home work, research of a country, place, house, vacation you can do lots of things. But then the other people have a point enjoying nature is good because it gets you healthy strong and it will get playing sports more and having fun outside instead of staying in side all day doing nothing staring at your computer screen not wanting to get sleep or going out side so both pretty much the same to me but I do with the first opionion because computers are the best!",8
1490,"Dear local newspaper, The effects Computers have on people is that people realie on them and thats not good because they have less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First of all, having less time exercising is not good because @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people ent up fighting obesscicley. ""You don't want to be one of those people trust me"" said @PERSON1. Second, enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of air by enjoying nature. ""You also have a lot of fun"" said @LOCATION1. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is fun and who doesn't love that. ""Spending time with the family is fun cause you get to go places,"" said @PERSON3. ""Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends,"" said @PERSON2. Those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good.",6
1317,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them? If so, then maybe we should @CAPS1 something. Toomany people have issues with their vision due to starring at computers to long. Also, people miss out on other outdoor activities as well. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their job then there missing out on same of the other important things in life such as, interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or just simply spending time with their close ones. Now, are you for or against this descison of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. I know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are. Things such as sports, nature, riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day. Only fun and energized people get out and get active. Last but not least, @CAPS1 you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day? If so then get up and go have fun! Take the wife and kids on a hike or go and ride a bike, its awesome excersise for you, family and friends and its actually fun! So, its now or never. @CAPS1 you want to be at home on a computer all day or @CAPS1 you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends? Most impotantly @CAPS1 you want to be energized and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? Well, without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make! So, get up, grab the kids and get going on your new and energized, pain free life.",8
391,"People should ues computers, they do benefit to society. More and more people use them @DATE1 and agree that these vertual portals of information and comunication are extremely helpful. Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of coarse to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it an through a whole wasteful process to get that paper.If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours, finding that information on the internet would be so much faster! Lastly, in the future everything will eventually be run with computers, they are the then now and later! They'll never get old! Computers are extremly helpful with endless information. A lot of people @DATE1 are very sensitive about our enviroment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternitive for paper is a computer. Once for school i was assigned a paper; i looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single peice of paper had been used! Ok so i know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely eco friendly and like i said before is a great alternitive to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was token and shows that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already @DATE2 and we are using the computer for so much. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off we'll order of computers/touch screans. More and more people are coming up with beter and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and love it and they will difenetly be used in the future. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're enviomentaly useful and a great alternitive to paper, they help you find the information you need fast, and proffesor grant states"" i do all my work on the computer, without it i would be lost.""

924,"Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons folt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activitys. Even though the computer has lots of things, and it is very interesting. people. Should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things, so I think it's there fult if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasns that people don't get out and do other activitys, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys, so why blame computers. For example the television keeps people from doing other activitys, but their not talking about stop that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget things like that. So it would be the person's fult if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activitys, because it's there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers, but it's still not computer's falty it your's.",8

Computer can help you earn in many ways one way you could learn from computers is students can go online and got information for their school projects by finding this information it can help the students get better grades. Also the students can use the computer as a way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play and without knowing this they are learning and studying for school. Another way you could too a is from online classes. This could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes. As you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help famlies stay connected when they live so far away from you.

In my predictionI say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt you eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes there bed time. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have myspace and facebook ... and more and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends thats one of the main reasons kids go on and there is other electronic devices that stops kid from exersicing and stuff like that such as a psp go or xbox @NUM1 or ds, dsi playstation @NUM2 and @NUM3.

Lastly computers give you something to do in your free time, such as playing games. First of all, I know many people think that others wasted their time on computers. But most computer users us the computer as a tool to learn and get work done. There are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want. If you want to know more about different cultures such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. There are websites to tell you everything you wih want to know. Computers also help yet work done. There are multiple programs designed to make writing papers or presenting information much easier @MONTH1 people use these programs to yet ahead in their work and present facts easier by using these programs it is very hard to lose and work that you do because it is all saved into the computer.

Some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch video made by other people, while some people @MONTH1 spend to much time on this many offers know moderaton and spread their time even other websites hard videos that are used to portray important issues, for example the president has given many through @CAPS4 videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. Lastly, computers are a great way to communate with distant firends and family. There are so many ways to do, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. My family being immigrants from another country my family. Thinks this is a vauables tool for talking with our family, and I am sure that htere are many ohters who use the computer this way as well. People also make and keep in touch with great friends through the @CAPS4. I use @CAPS3-mail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that I haven't seen in tears, my parents have also found long lost friends that they had before we moved through facebook I also allows people to communate important ideas faster than a letter could. Many scientists use the @CAPS4 to publish ideas and experiments.

1217,I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us. Also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that.,4
1225,"Dear local Newspaper. I think we should keep improving technolgy on computers. Some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside. I personally think that the computer is important, if people don't use it none stop. There are many reasons wht the computer is inportant. First of all there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to. The internet is a good way to find out about a place. Also if you are going on vacation and you would like to know alittle about the vacation spot you can just look it up on the computer. Another reason is the computer can help you study a place too. Also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer. If you are disagrreing with someone than you can find quick and easy information. All you do is look up something and you can find it. And you can learn new things that you have no clue about. Most of the time the internet is very helpful. One more reason is communication. On the computer there are many ways you can communicate with other people. If you have friends or family far away then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house. Also if you are not sure about homework or something like that you can just ask a friend to find out. And you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch. Sometimes people use that feature for bad or inapropriate things. But you can do something about it so you don't get those bad things. The internet can help you alot in your every day life. You can learn about new places, you can do research, and you can communicate with friends or fumily. If we keep improving technology you will be able to do alot more than you can do now. The internet will be able to help you alot more in your every day life. Now you can see that the internet can help people and its not just keeping people inside that is why I think we should keep improving technology.",8
263,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending alot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quility time with friends and family. The dangers of online interaction, and the risk of having your information stolen. Countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world. Children and adults alike have lost face time or interraction with other human beings face to face. Before computers kids played outside running and playing around. While in present day less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside. Computers are not a bad thing, but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems. The additon of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it. The invention of @CAPS2, and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one. Online chat allows people to send hatefull and vulgar messages to their enemys without showing their face. In some cases some teens were harrased online so bad they committed suicide. Another bad thing about @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a "" meeting place"" and was kidnapped and never seen against last year. Most of these victims do not return or are found. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases. Millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money. Four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites. If this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt. These hackers know who you are, your family, your personal information, and where you live. Internet usage needs to be cut down to sites. If we do not then usage will increase, there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen.",10
755,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial affect on society. They have @CAPS4 many features. options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, ""@CAPS1 not use a phone to talk to others."" @CAPS2 these are many reasons @CAPS1 talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago. Me and my cousin @PERSON2 were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working @PERSON2 went down stars to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound, @PERSON2 had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones wren't opperating, i hopped to the computers in her room to quickly ""chat"" with my dad and tell him what happened. From these on, my dad called on ambulance and @PERSON2 was allright. @CAPS4, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save somenes life! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a stuident has to write a paper for school about the @CAPS3, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of kodedge. All you have to do is go to a search engin such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there's millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knoledge on. @PERSON1, a high school teacher, states that ""@PERCENT1 of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and reseacrh."" @CAPS4, there you have it, the computer's a great resource for information. One last reason computers are @CAPS4 beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long. The heard of the company is not going to hire you if you are not expierenced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer @CAPS2, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that ""@PERCENT2 of buisnesses involve using a computer"" Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second, it's important start learning more about them as soon as possible! I think now it's very clear how important computers are in our society. They help increase communication, a great source for knoledge, and bhelp prepare you for jobs. With each passing day, computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place.",9
86,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 computers become more and more a part of everyday life people begin to question wether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides acess to the world wide we. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. ""@CAPS2 in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary, @PERSON1. Also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information the web olds thousands of different web pages. With these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge of the moders life style. Web cames @CAPS1 on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email is the main comunication system for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re connected with a lot of people I didn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benifit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many proffessions using simulations on computers to help learn hot to do their job nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations @CAPS1 part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games. Also many games and computer simulation have helped many people learn new things, @CAPS3 are countless learning games and simulations that are acessable by computer. Simulations add huge benifets to owning a computer. @CAPS1 technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck @CAPS1 information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations. The benifits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benifits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way.",8
653,"@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",8

499,"A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with eachother, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology, prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computer are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue.",9

1671,"@CAPS8 more and more technology is being invented, people use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not neccessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my freind @CAPS1 for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But then he got his computer. @CAPS1 had suddenly lost interest in exercise and spend his whole day checking his e-mail instead of training. But he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers. Experts say that @CAPS5 with computers at home get only @PERCENT1 of the exercise @CAPS5 without computers get. @CAPS5 with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1, who headed this study said, @CAPS5 are taught by society that computers can do such wonderful things and educate them. However, they are not taught how bad they can be for you health when used too much."" @CAPS6, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain you eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us @DATE1, there was a blind lady named @PERSON5, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spend too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientist, @PERSON3, reported, ""@CAPS8 more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3."" @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 an fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. ""Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!"" @CAPS12 reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your @CAPS5! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and health. Is this @CAPS12 you want for your self and generations to come?""",11
255,"Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have.",8

All of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you seen for years but you can’t! if you had a computer you would be to learn about more places and people, it would improve your hand eye coordination, and you could interact with people without having time to meet them! Computers definitely have good effects on people! First, computers help to improve hand-eye coordination. It is a fact that people who own one or more computers in a household have better hand-eye coordination than people without computers! Don’t you want good hand-eye coordination too? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand-eye coordination in our school, now that her parents have bought her a computer, she is a lot quicker and definitely has better hand-eye coordination. She said that just looking at the screen and she wanted to go helped a lot. Also, computer time can states that computers have been proven to improve hand-eye coordination in the course of a year. that sounds pretty simple to me! Next, computers also  allow people to learn about other faraway places and people. Local middle school teacher, @PERSON2, uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. That sounds a lot more interesting than just talking! My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see pictures and articles about places. You can learn about any place you want on a computer, doesn’t that sound nice? I’m sure there is one place you’ve always wanted to learn about!

In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people just talk online to their friends rather than going out to meet them. How convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, “Computers are geat inf you can't meet someone, you just talk online”. Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computer are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, your sitting on that same couch you look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an article right in front of you read more about it learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden you lose your grip, but you catch your laptop just in time, what hand-eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet you sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer you cant meet her. She says it’s alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out! It’s so simple! Computers teach hand-eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and interact with more people. So what are you doing readers? Get out there and get a computer.",9

Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore.

There are countless reasons, people are spending way too much time on the technology we have already such as the computer. @CAPS9 of wasting time on this device, people arent excersicing, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Even if they did aerobic excersize for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories @CAPS9 you can only burn @NUM5 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they became obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. With out a doubt, computers are like poison, if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use to much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes you're lucky. ""@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cutdown as we speak. This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air & see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!"" pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speach. Too bad only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 could relate to kid message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never gone out into nature. @CAPS9 of this, people are saying who cares about nature & the rain forest? ""@CAPS9 of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are loosing their homes. When a pool was given to the @PERCENT3 of people who don't ever go outside to ejoy nature @PERCENT1 of them responded that it was @CAPS9 they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet."" I love @CAPS3 mommy. I @CAPS10 her everyday before dinner,"" sadly states eight year old, @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A @NUM5 year old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3 was on his death bed what he wished that he could change about his life, he answerd, ""I wish that I didn't use the computers as much I got to know @CAPS3 family & friends better! @ORGANIZATION3 died lates that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients @CAPS1 they started drugs in the first in the first place, @PERCENT4 answered that it was @CAPS9 they didn't feel love by their families. After they answered, they were asked @CAPS1 they didn't feel love, @PERCENT5 of them answered @CAPS9 the people that they love were to busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your love ones' in the hospital do not use the computers. Obviously, computers are aweful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family & nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?""",12

First, the computer teach as hand-eye coordination. Second, we can learn about faraway places. Finally, we can make friends from all over the world. When, the ball goes right out of the parts! the plastic object with a screen(computers) teach us hand-eye coordination. It teachs us this by making our eyes stay on the screen, twhile our hand are on the hard, smooth keyboard. Children need hand-eye coordination for ball-playing sports like baseball, basketball, soccer and more. When your in high school and play sports well, you @MONTH1 get scholar-ships to go to college. College is important because it has a big role in our life so we @MONTH1 earn great jobs. Learning about faraway place like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and so on is very intersting. Unless, your learning about it throught looks, which are dull and borring. The interneat has taken over our and it is resentlessly and without hesitation.

670,"Some people believe that computers are a positive effect to people, but its positive because it rots you brain. I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased. Absolutley, computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it. Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they wont be learning anything and just kill major brain cells. When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they wont know anything because of the computer. Also, This is a big problem for familys because they dont hang out with each other because their always on the computer. The excuse for parents is ""@CAPS1 im on the computer"" then they never go and the children get very upset. This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you. All it is, is cause and effect. My friends on @NUM1 has anger problems and doesn't listen to anyone all because her family never hung. Consequently, peope spend most of their time inside on the computer, you guessed right! my sister is on the computer @NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature. People can get that @LOCATION1 were they haute to go outside and we dont want that do eve. Doctor @CAPS2 brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good. The computer is defeating that purpose. On the other hand, the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered. Sometimes you just want to talk to old time friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for alot of things but to much of it is not good for us lastly, i'd like to say the computer has great purpose but i think it just makes excuses for us so we dont spend time with our family, dont go outside enough to enjoy the nature.",8
1028,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society. They allow people to communicate with eachother, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school.. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advance in technology has upgraded computers, and now allows people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. As well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily. It is not difficult to do, like writing a letter would be, so people can communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instace, they could learn about foreigh plaus. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway, they could type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. @CAPS6 more would help people, especially students to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more orginized. Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fast while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are @CAPS6 and when they go to school, they would already know it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, @CAPS6, and allows students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society.",10
179,"Dear @CAPS1, You @MONTH1 have heard that there are up-sides and down-sides to using a computer. There are many more up-sides though. For example, you can communicate with people, conduct business, and you can use it to learn. A computer is a big need in today's growing technological advances. Communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer. You can use computers to meet people from different countries. By doing this we can learn what life is like for them. Through social networks, such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can make plans with friends. Computers are an important communication technology. Today most business is conducted over the internet or on a computer. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is all computerized today, and that is a major trade way today. A lot of business transactions and presentations are done out on a computer for maximum efficiency. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there. Computers are a huge advancement in business. Computers help us learn a lot about, just about, everything. Search engines let us type in keywords and find multiple websites on that topic. Computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click. This research can be used to write essays in school. Computers help us to learn in school and outside of it. A computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses. It @MONTH1 have a few down-sides, but it has many more up-sides. Computers allow you to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up.",8
1615,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a @ORGANIZATION1 who believes that computers have a positive effect on people for one computed help promote hand-eye coordination. @CAPS5 there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving they're home. @CAPS6 computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, ""@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car. On that road, this being that they have no eye hand coordination, @CAPS6 I that it computers were in the of every person in the world there would be less acidents a year. Secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind. to a distant and or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7 there is the fact that a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. @CAPS6 I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia, @CAPS6 there is the fact that people can contact and talk to people through the @CAPS3 for one this allows you to contact a long lost friends. @CAPS5 there is the fact that you can talk to theme @CAPS5 @CAPS6. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that @CAPS9 reading this letter and sharing it to your company I believe that you should support my cause. This is @CAPS4 computers improve hand-eye coordination, link people to other people and places and @CAPS6 allow people to talk via the @CAPS3.",9
1306,"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home.",8
1542,"Do you remember school projects sitting down bored and watching your @CAPS1 stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your mind? Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper untill you found something now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into google, a search site, and up comes @NUM1 things on that country. In fact @PERSON1 a expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 eisier depending on the topic. Also you no longer have to work a redundunt type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay. Anything speelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knolage, from a learning stand point computers are extremly good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games, both gaming websites and play games. These game while not only are fun improve handeye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writirs and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2-box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide exteme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14. In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benifits us greatly. We can now learn about new exiting things have fun while improving eyesight and we don't have to wait.",10
1668,"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!",9

My opinian is that people schood spend more time out-doors with the fred - and family I whant people to know that ther a wold out side and to not get to adictide the the techno wold that my opinion I do not know @CAPS1 you like @CAPS2 but I think you shood try @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 you do'not like @CAPS2 get in to a they will help you and a lot @CAPS3 writing this because I whant peole to now that ther a lot of places that are yet to be discoverd so go out ther and enjoy like because life only come one time so enjoy @CAPS2 whith happy time and good time do'not speed @CAPS2 crying and sad like @CAPS2 like this is your last day on this wold.,8
975,"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today.",8
1478,"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other contantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful?",9
1005,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree.

1494,"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with.",10
225,"Computers, @CAPS1 how far we've come. Computers hold many opertunities for the world and… we don't use any of them. Computers have taken many and left them without excersize. Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never excersising part woudl kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she sugested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I was a @NUM2 years old in a @NUM1 year old body. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to anouther. Don't make the same mistake as me readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend name @PERSON1, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, your wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stoped my addiction before it got to serious, but many others like @PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now, should understand how dangerous and read this is, ""@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!"" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer. It doesn't work, computers are so attention grabbing, you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I.ming me. Thats really just sad. By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you'll have, the less of a life you'll have. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. The more you chat on chat room to strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are the devils tools. They will most certainly destroy you, readers. Alway be careful, computers are not as they seem.",12
511,"Dear Newspaper, I think a computer is not something bad for you. A computer can help you do many things @CAPS1 could help you learn, chat with friends, and @CAPS1 can entertain you. A computer can get you sucessful in life @CAPS1 helps you learn a lot of things such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults , and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way, @CAPS1 is good because because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes just remeber dont get to close to the screen. The computer is all about fun, you have millions of websites you can go on. To have fun for example @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com those are the three main ones I go on they are so fun. They have tons of games for kids and for adults too. I Have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and its also very fun. Yes I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes but who cares just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get to close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes.",8
1643,"To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even enterteinment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it.",11
412,"Dear @CAPS1, I beleive that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects of places you think are interesting you don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know any thing about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2"" in a google search, and press enter. There you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. You could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at anytime. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Seond, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. We are depleeting our oxygen supply and destroying habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use to send documents and papers, we could bring to tax appointments and pair suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could asign the homework email it to the student the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for somethings, but we would be using in way less. People could also use less fossil. We could talk via the internet and things like skype to communicate witness waring to and burn. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments, more efficient travel and even every day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also hep us find more efficient way. They could help find a mroe efficient feel, efficient of it could help make a teleportation device. It could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every day life. When you get up in the @TIME1, imagein being able to screen and being able to have a hot shower, your breakfast and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of any reasons for having computers from school reasearch to space and beyond.",10
6,"Dear @LOCATION1, I think that computers have a negative affect on us! How many people have acess to a camputer daily in america.. @NUM1 and how many people go on at least an hour a @NUM2. That means that @NUM3 people cant exercise are wasting many are have the posibility of physical @CAPS1 that sound good to you? Think of everything you done when you write a letter. I got up and got all the materials and sit back down. After In done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back. Well this is what I had to do. Now think how you write an email sitdown and move your fingers. Do you see the difference? @CAPS2 instead of getting a good walk to your friends house to talk to you just in him/er. Did you know that you can literally but from on your computer. Instead of around with this that can add anything you your computer gives away information they information lead to that and then everthing you have wouldbe gone. All this so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can phisically get hurt for being on the computer, to long. @NUM4 thing is that when you at a computer @CAPS2 what happened to my grandpa is that when you are in a wood chair all day you can get ardthritis in your muscle @CAPS3 thing th.",8
1079,"Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time.",8
1657,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future. Computers are a standard of the buissnes world and are hevily depended on. People are even needing internet access on cellphones to stay up to date on stocks, shipments and important emails. Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find any were. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books. So if you truly think about it computers save us a tremendus amount of time with the things we do. Once again I say ""computers better owe life not hurt it.""",8
788,"Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the affects that computers have on kids. Computers lets kids do what they want and They dont have to travel far to see certin things. Like if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 your not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pics and information right on the computer in a couple minutes. Its good if you want to see it in person but you wont want to pay money for plane tikets or travel really far when you can just see it from home. Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like myspace, @CAPS2, and games also its got almost everything you can think of. So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer. I think that computer can sometimes be a little adictive but you got to learn to stay off of it most of the time but it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer. Computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it. It has information web sites like google or bing to look up anything you want to look up. Computers are almost everywhere in phones, I-pods, and even some are put in car like police cars. Computers are very useful to people of the world @DATE1 I bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building like hospitials, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like radioshack. Your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school. In my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them. So i think that computers are very useful and can teach you a lot about the things that go on in our world to day so I disagree with what scientist or people say about computers and the affects it has on certin people of @DATE1.",8
63,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They are good because you can learn things educational. You can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information down for yourself. Computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information. @CAPS1 you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet. These are some internet sources that are @NUM1 to answer questions. @CAPS1 we didnt have computers, then @CAPS1 you have a question, then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work. Another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. You can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather. You can find all this cut on television, but you never knows when it would come on. With computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them. With Computers, you can also keep information down. You could use @ORGANIZATION1 and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion. You can also make graphs on the computer. This way your graphs will nice have alright time and @CAPS1 you would to go information that in a @CAPS1 there were no computers then your information would not be as and you can it. I believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat. I believe computers positive effect in people.",8
326,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence.",10
810,"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great.",8
389,"Dear newspaper, I've read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other. You can use @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way. Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too. It's muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books.The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you dont even need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers your normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mases. So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids.",8
1045,"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have @NUM1. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states ""@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out @NUM5 kids use the internet to research things for @CAPS2 & projects.

I know you thinking there a lot of ""@CAPS4"" thing on the internet dont want my kids to see, conversly you can set limits & child block. & you also dont want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of excercise. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4.

747,"Dear newpapers journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. The @LOCATION1 has The highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer and work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up eveything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what your typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their person's personal information! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now. They have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus.",8
1122,"I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one. Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends, allow you to acess information more efficiently, and have increased our man power in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends. This function keeps kids in touch and active. Eventhough instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life it can also be amazingly helpful. Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easly contacted online. I was able to let them know @NUM1 a matter of seconds. Like wise, with this online communication you can also talk and and video chat as if you right there with your friends not everyday do you get to go hang out with your friends so this is an easy alternative. Not only is quick and easy it's free. Computers keep kids off their phones and from jucking up the bill and causing those loud annoying phone bill conversations how to limit your texting. The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. The internet allows people to acess millions of websites and light speed. Every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost. They provide an easier way to life that us lazy @CAPS1 need to survive. The internet keeps us updated and informed on whats going on all around the world without even going there. We need the internet and we couldn't acess it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date. Recently I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for @CAPS2 a process that would take a human weeks. They also help us be different and more creative people. With the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much. They're lead us to research the unknown areas of the world where @NUM2 years ago a scientist with a pad of paper didn't have dare to even think about. Computers have linked the world through communication and information and have exelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society.",10
1159,"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make.",12
752,"In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they dont play as much and start to get fat but that its their decision. Also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer @NUM1 people dont get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and dont want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addictid to the computer.",7

I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs works on computers all day. @NUM1 each sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family. YEah sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. They can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was and I found out she was a famous sinher, someone I didn't know but heard about. Chantrail @CAPS1 a @NUM2 grade student says ""only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers. If you want to learn something new or meet new people then I suggest you stop eating those chips, get off that couch and use the computer.",8

Those are the @NUM1 reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps. I seen a lot of video and movies about kidnaps when an older men or women starts taking to some young kids and they go meet some place and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid for example when I use to be on the computer all day I would get out to get something to eat and some times I would go in the bathroom to get food and then I notice that thats not the kochen @CAPS1 feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reson is that computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay in the computer all the time sitting on the chair without sun light or exercise @CAPS1 will make you want to stay here more and its not good for you mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer, the more you the more you will want to stay. So don't stay on the computer because there is bad things in there, @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please don't stay on the computer for a long time.",7

My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place we might want to but our plane tickets threw the computer site then after you get the plane tickets you can go and discover the places/place. Second, in a couple years everything will be computers. However, @CAPS3 will be threw a computer site (world wide web). We will get our education online. There will be games online. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family you can go online to talk, they also make life easier beacuse instead of going to your family or friends house you can go on to aim or what ever chat site you got and chat threw instant messaging. In conclusion, computers do benefit society. First, you can learn about places you want to go to. Second, everything will be threw computers in a couple years. Lastly, computers make life easier.",7
521,"I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computes. I say this because computers can sometimes get addicting. The people who are addicted will only know about stuf on the internet. people need exersise. They will not get exursise by sitting in front of an computer all day. Computers are addicting. The people who spent most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted. When they get addicted they will probly fail in school because they do not do their homework. Don't you hate it when you feel week and tierd? Well that is how the people who sit at computers all day feel like alot! @CAPS1 people whant to stay healthy then they should get some exersise daily insted of sitting in front of a computer all day. Alot of people get annoyed when they dont know about stuff when it happens. Most of the people who do that are the people who are mostly on the computers. I say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer. That is why I strongly believe that people spend to much time on computers rather than. This is because firstly computers get addicting, secondly people need exersise @CAPS1 they want to be and stay healthy lastly @CAPS1 people like to know things the only way they will find out is on the computer",7
1621,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world.",10
161,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online @CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. for example, when you learn how to type, you can memerize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you what to do, you don't have to serch the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. @CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about china, you can use the computer. How many times would china be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. @CAPS3 last example is that a serch engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. @CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.",10
204,"You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?",10
453,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past their have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature and getting less exercise. I you to be in of negative effects on people. @CAPS1's important decision is up to you. ",9
1495,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now.",8
352,"Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outside and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outside and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outsid nature. Let me explain, people and kids these days do have alot of exercising. People who don't exercising can gran weight if they don't exercising at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game. Wouldn't you agree the kids and adults can hang out with there frienda and family. Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outside more offing with their friend or family. You might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then staying on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outside and enjoying the nature. Amazingly, people know what nature is but the don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adult should spend time by going outside then stayin at their house because @PERCENT1 of the world dont have computer at all.",7
599,"There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society. I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society.",8
567,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bed thing for many resons. First i think it's good because it can help school work like to do a research and for other things that you might have to do for school. A secound reson on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. It also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a web-cam. All their computers can be realy helpful they can also be bad for your health and family. I agree that it can give less time exercising, instead of being on the computer you can go to the park or walk your and many other things then just bring on the comuter all day. It can also distroy your interacting with family and and friend if you stay in the house all the time useing the computers and your family and friends want to spend some time with you and your just on the camper. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper wher the reasons why i think computers can be a good thing and a bed thing. I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we didn't have computers we wouldnt have most of the things we now have in the world if it wasn't for computers. That's why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it. Those were the opinions i had on computers.",8
827,I think computers have a postitive affect on people. Computers are very important to society. You can still interact with Your Family and friends either in @CAPS1 chat or @CAPS2. Computer are also helpful for applying for @CAPS3 like you can look for @CAPS3 you like. You can do @CAPS5 exciseses and useful for @CAPS5 essays. If you have a laptop you can bring it anywhere you want you don't have connect anything it take wireless and you can connect to the @CAPS6. You can look up stuff on the @CAPS6 for your homework and other stuff. Buy things without having to go to the store. These are reasons why computers have a postitive affect on people.,6
1262,"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure.",8
434,"I think we need our computers. If we dont have competer's we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in anther state or country. I no how there is texting now but some people dont even have phones or nothing how can you connect to them you cant call it might not be free with the phone palan you have. If a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. Are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. And we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. There are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature I dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. Also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whetever holiday it is. There not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing. Sometimes, people will more fron of you that your ollways on the computer if your not dont worry at least you get to email your family that you dont ever seen. These reasons are my opinion that dont get rid of computers and other things.",7
870,"Computers are a nice item to have but they are bad if you don't know how to control your time. Many people @CAPS3 days don’t get enough exercise and the lack of healthy people is costing the @CAPS1 tax payers millions. Also, people aren't enjoying life as much as they would if they didn't use a computers all of the time and thier are many people who have completely cut themselves off frfom their families and friends. I am positive that when you are done reading this you will be, one hundred percent pursuaded that the effects computers have on people are bad. To begin with, many people spend to much time on a computer instead of being outside or execising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 talking about healthcare, and anc easy sollution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise. More ofen in order to stay healthy. As technology to affect our lives, we used to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day. In addition to people not people dont enjoy life as much, You only live once and life is special, so why sitting all day? I many anymore because they spend all of there @CAPS3 are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers. need to be and I can tell you that you life will not being you in enjoyable luife. Lastly, computers have made a lot of people when people got to Too many people a major view when it comes to family and friends. Although computers are an easy way to communicate to people, they should not be the anly thing you use to talk to friends and family. So as you can see, computers are causing us to lead on-healthy lives because our priorities on health are why to low. They also keep you from enjoying life, to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled. I am positive that I have pursuaded you not to spend so much time on a computer. So next time you are using a computers, think of all the things you are missing out in life!",9
783,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 of all I would like to say that I love your story and puzzels in your paper and I think I have a story you guys can use. It's about people that is addicted to computers. I guess you guys wondering about what I mean about addicition to computers. Well im going to give you three reason about this. My @CAPS1 reason is people isn't spending a lot of time with there family. I say this because most of the time couples get into arguments because the person thats addicted to the internet isn't doing want he/her is suppose to do. For example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off. Another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have. I know people that's addicted to online chat rooms and I sometimes get worried about them because half of the time they don't know who there talking to! It could be anybody even a pedafile. My final reason is because some people just don't care. Some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides online chating when they can be doing a essay or something helpful or caring. You know I use to addicted to the computer myself and because of that I almost failed all my classes and because of that I don't use the computer to talk or anything such as that but now I just read my email or write my essay. And that concludes my or should I say your next top story.",7
1234,"More and more people use computers everyday. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of excercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best resturant locations are, the best holers, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chating. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! Thats a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything thats going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a persons daily life.",8
823,"Some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside. In my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot. It's @CAPS1 to use the computer to chat with freinds, search some stuff you never seen. I say this because some people get addicted to computer games, or talking to your freinds the whole day. Next reason is to go outside, you can enjoy more stuff like sports, tag, and other activities. Instead of talking to a freind on the computer go to the park and talk or invite them over to you house. Another reason why I the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things. I hope you have found my interduction good and reading on. My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer fetures. The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted on computer, it's @CAPS1 to go on it some time's but not to much. It is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold. If you have a dog you should take for a walk or walk with your freinds. My next reason is going outside playing sports or running alround playing tag. Instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun thing's you can do outside. You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at. That way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day. The last reason why I perfer nature over computers is learning on how to do something. It's better to learn stuff in real life than in computer's. Your dad can teach you how stick bricks together to make a chimny, or on how to use a lawn mower to cut other peoples yard's to make money.

248,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I Computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. It can do many things like help you learn something new and see new/old friends. Even some people do online education. Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games. Computers are a great benifit to us and can be useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There can be a lot to learn too. Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places, people, animals, plants, food, etc. I have once had to find a recipe for carmel apples and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for there education. There are online college and online high school. Its like a new way to be home schooled. Not everyone can go to big @CAPS1 so it is easier for them to use an online college. Also, lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends. I friends, everyone has friends either new friends or old friends. Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter. With computer you can now send a letter faster then before. Its now called an email. Which you just type what you want and click..send it off to your friend. Not all use an email, some use instant messaging. An example of that would be aim or meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1 to hear and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have that same issue. Well with the computer you can now see people! chat and see them. For instance @ORGANIZATION2 is a way to see your friends like that. Its a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games. Kids them even teens and adults love. Whenever your bored you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchesed and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very little kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with you friends online with a online game. I know when I get bored I go on the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are great and there are pently of more things you can do other than what I was taking about. I hope I have convinced I or showed you how computers are a benifit to us people.",9
1452,"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community.",12
433,"The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers. Though these divices @MONTH1 seem entertaining and helpfull. Well that is not all true. Computers are being used for more then just work. It seems to be the peoples new way of comunication. Communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives. There is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others. Though computers seem to abuse the privlage of communication. For talking on an online chat sight is easier and more convient for people. The people in those charts are not always sho they claim to be. This pushes a huge danger on those signts @CAPS3 children of all ages now are using them. These children fo not always know who they are talking to, but @CAPS3 its online they say anything that into their mind. The way @CAPS2 talk tao people in person is not the same on line. When communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to short hand things. Such as the word ""you"" would be spelled ""u"". These quick changes happen without thinking, and become a natural habit. These changes quickly become a part of our communication and writing. So instead of seeing the sentence ""@CAPS1 did you think about her project"", @CAPS2 will see ""wat did u tink bout her pro."" @CAPS3 of this many childrens grades could be affected. For their spelling will soon become and the vocabulary will be, or all in slang. This vocabulary change could be prevented if computer were not used as much. Today @CAPS2 are seeing going outside. No one ever needs to go anywhere if all theire communication can be done at home. This isn't just hurting ourselves but also the environment. The less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted. The times @CAPS2 do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is hurting our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the to make a garden, plant some tree's or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. If @CAPS2 would all just take the time, maybe only ten minutes adays to help our environment it would be helping our bodies and also helping our planet. This would reduce the amount of people using computer's and change the way @CAPS2 see our civilization today. So please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but @CAPS2 only have one of us and one ofour planet. @CAPS2 dont want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology.",11
662,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but in wasen't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's.",6
605,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you allow you self to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes a day at the most that will allow you plenty of time to go outside & excersize.

1748,"Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.",9
1604,"Although many people love to be on computer palying video games and have cyber chats, most of them don't know how bad a computer can be even though I experience a great time on the computer, I know how bad it is. Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer, if you stay on the computer for to long it can over heat and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is side effects. you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long. Those headaches over time can become even worst. You @MONTH1 even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addictition with computers you @MONTH1 become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it @MONTH1 work its way to your daily routines causing you to have to play it daily and more thatn the average person does. Your personality @MONTH1 also change with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be very dangerous. if your child gets on to one he @MONTH1 accidentlly link heimself to a dirty or bad websites. He then to the negatives of a computer. On a computere your child will probally be shown things like words to pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer. Computers are addicting, they cause problems and are dangerous wrong in my opinion should be stopped. Now you think we should do about computers.",8
1582,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time.",10
850,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up todays and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordinatin ability. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. Handeye coordinatin is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that.",10
516,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me.",8
654,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.",10
197,"Dear newspaper, I know that computers can place a person in its spell, but in reality it's one of the most necesary things we need in our lifetime. Computers are used for many things like school work, planning that trip you always wanted to go to, and reading the latest news. Read the following to know just how important computers really are. You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do as you can so you have that at. When you realize that the one book you find on it wont help you with the score you want you realize that the nextplace to look is the computer. The computer gives you an unlimited amount of information that will help you in any report. When a teacher gives you a book to do a biography on, for example, ""The life and times: @PERSON1"" You want to go beyond what they give you and search, for instances, his neighborhood, his inspiration, and the influences he had. You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a ""five nights and four days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1, you want to know what better sale they have. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look. You can'@CAPS3 look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you cant search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and that six of those seven parents have deal on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips you'll find a deal or @CAPS2's for the lowest only find out by computer. If you live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and you want to have a trip to the @LOCATION1 this deal is really good. If you live in the @LOCATION2 and you know the hottest day in the @DATE1 is coming you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time then you wont know that all the beaches open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a @CAPS3.V. watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only will it tell you news in your erea, but will tell you about that devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to help. So not only is the computer good for going on @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember. They also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in @DATE1. Maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is.",10
587,"More and more people use computers in fact about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T has computers, everyone uses them. I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good things what do you think? As I was say computers are good for emailing, even I.ming. lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and tree to your coach asking what time you need to be at the feild. Also theres I.Ming, its wen you can talk to your friends online its a great way to comunicate and meet new people. Emailing is great, its so hi-tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you. I once did that my aunt's lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did, they were eye catching. Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers. A.T.M. and car are ran off of computers. So having it for a job is great. Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you are one? Lastly, school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence, homework and . If he didn't have that, he would be lost. Its also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that. Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's call power school. Computers are great for school. I think every one should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and school work. If it wasn't for computers we would really know as much as we do now. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T have them. Computers are gonna help you through life alot, welcome to the real world.",9
53,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad. These points to computer wellfare are they bring sourses, their is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused they still use them. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it could be used for good. First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books. Their are search engines that you can find your topics on. Then, when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over. They can show the other side of they story that they didn't say in the book. your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home, that itself is a step that you aren't considering. For instance if people are on a lot @PERCENT1 of the time is research. Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer. They can talk, send pictures, or play games. For example, i play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game is fun as being with them, quoted from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work"". This shows that even large important still use it for work. people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer. None the less, the computers are at their begining and they will further improve. So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer. This advancement is going to advance again and again so there won't be a way to stop it thus, people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers. Then you will try to stop them with ""computers eat your brain"". We all know that is garbage. To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others. I @CAPS3 that if people want to use computer they can. I say this with the sources, the friends and the advanement.",8
754,"You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find aout about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends and for personal entertainment. Some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possability of research, etc. Would be much more difficult. For example: computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right in your name, so no travel is required. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows and brochures for presentation, as well. If we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websits and e-mail helps you keep intouch with anyone around the world. You can write e-mails, access live chat or even webcam. E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. Live chat iswhen you chat over text on the computer. Webcam is face to face interacting which givs off the effect of talking in person: @CAPS1 benefit is that communicates over the computer doesnt cost a thing. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. The computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination, along with staying orginized @CAPS2, pictures, videos and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer making it easy for you to open them at @CAPS1 time. Computers @MONTH1 take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it. I think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology.",9
282,"Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world.",8
1763,"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3."" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, ""@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools."" @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom."" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. ""@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me.",12
1318,"Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing.",8
1628,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you.",10
9,"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future.",9
85,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are they a good benifit for society or a bad benifit for society? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight, health problems, diseases like dieabeties, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can aviode this by turning of the computer and just go for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer now these day people want do this. Thats one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways. They can feel dissapointed worried about you, even concerned. When you are always on the computer you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everthing together, and the all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you; or visiting you and hanging out with you. You would feel dissapointed because you loss your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why is think computers don't do good they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't way good is for a main reason safty. Those days computers have all the websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing when you're on the computer people don't even think about their safty and thats how things happen. For example you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your friend when it really wasn't. So you see safty is a real big problem with these computers. That's why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society. As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit? My opinion stillis the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benifit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer.",10
840,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer help with hand- eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didnt have the right information? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book. Thats why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect.",8
541,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept. So everyone I strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers.",8
