Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. “I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed.

7467,"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. ",3

A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings.

Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land.

I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool.

He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn’t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn’t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. ,2

The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3).

7401,"Setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  “ a water-depleting @NUM1.” When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like “battery acid.” Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.",3
6467,The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight.

The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He also says, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence",3

This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.",2
6181,"The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. ",3

Also he says, “Summertime “rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain”. It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song “summertime” He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist.",2

Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1.

It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  ",2

All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on.

He rubbed it off though, and kept “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement…” He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned.

The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.",3

It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. ",1

It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located.

7131,"The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1’l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn’t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. ",3
6613,"The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.",1
6413,The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.,2
6799,"Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiou",3
7197,"There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. ",3
6090,"There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.",1
7387,"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.” The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he’s running out of water when he says.“The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.",3
7335,"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.",3
7306,In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.,1
7360,"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven’t peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch’s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park.",2
6891,"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ""ghost town” he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong.",1
6755,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie).",3
6140,"The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.",1
7624,"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest make.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” is used as an important for character development.  ",3

He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite.",2
6387,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.",3

The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him.",1
7409,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “This statement proves that the cyclist wasn’t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “It was a good decision that the cyclist didn’t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.",2
6364,The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can’t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he’ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that’s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.,3
6239,"Setting is a very important element to the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.",2
6225,"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt.

Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult.
